<p>A society of revolutionary anarchists live on a moon orbiting the capitalist oppressors they fought against — over time, the community has begun to ossify, and unspoken hierarchies are forming.</p>
<p>In the midst of this, an anarchist physicist whose ideas are rejected as trivial and counter-revolutionary chooses to return to the “home planet” — ostensibly to spread the word of his ground-breaking discoveries, but also to embody the spirit of permanent revolution and try to shake his fellow anarchists out of their complacency.</p>
<p>Just an excellent book: compassionately explores the benefits and dangers of revolutionary anarchism, highlighting how hierarchies of unjust power develop and the injustices of life for the exploited — and exploiters — under capitalism.</p>    </div>
