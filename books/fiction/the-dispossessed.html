        <h1 class="title">The Dispossessed</h1>
        <p class="author">Ursula K. Le Guin</p>

        <p>
            A society of revolutionary anarchists live on a moon orbiting the
            capitalist oppressors they fought against — over time, the community
            has begun to ossify, and unspoken hierarchies are forming.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the midst of this, an anarchist physicist whose ideas are
            rejected as trivial and counter-revolutionary chooses to return to
            the “home planet” — ostensibly to spread the word of his
            ground-breaking discoveries, but also to embody the spirit of
            permanent revolution and try to shake his fellow anarchists out of
            their complacency.
        </p>
        <p>
            Just an excellent book: compassionately explores the benefits and
            dangers of revolutionary anarchism, highlighting how hierarchies of
            unjust power develop and the injustices of life for the exploited —
            and exploiters — under capitalism.
