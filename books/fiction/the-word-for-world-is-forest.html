        <p>
            In a future where all green life on Earth has been destroyed, the
            human army travel to an alien world of forests and enslaves its
            people to harvest lumber. The indigenous people, normally a peaceful
            society led by the visions of dreaming men and the direction of
            practical women, fight back viciously and overcome the soldiers
            &mdash; but knowing such violence, how can they return to their
            peaceful lives?

            A beautiful, brief and very difficult book: my copy begins with an
            essay by Le Guin on how the story became a "preachment" in light of
            her opposition to the Vietnam War, and asks if it's moral for an
            author to exert such influence over others and preach through their
            stories.
