        <p>
            Somewhere in a place between worlds there is a House: it is made up
            of a seemingly endless number of rooms, and a churning sea which
            provides all the food one needs to survive.
        </p>
        <p>
            Within the House there are two people — Piranesi (although that is
            not his name), and the Other — and seemingly no entrances or exits:
            how did these two come to be here?
        </p>
        <p>
            A neat little mystery, although not what I was expecting: I was
            anticipating something like Kitty Horrorshow’s <em>ANATOMY</em>, an
            exploration of emotion through the interaction between inhabitor and
            architecture — the novel is more conventionally character-driven and
            I wished we’d spent more time exploring the House.
