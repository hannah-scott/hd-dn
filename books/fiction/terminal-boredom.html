            This is a selection of science fiction short stories published in
            Japan between the 1960s and 1980s. Where I can find a publishing
            year I’ve included it.

            The male population has declined as a result of pollution and war,
            and all men are imprisoned at birth. One day, a girl sees a boy from
            out her window; she starts a secret dialogue with him, knowing that
            it is forbidden. He forces himself on her in an abandoned factory
            and is sent back to the camps; the story ends with her wondering how
            she can live knowing what she knows about men, and women.

            The narrator’s friend is put into cryosleep as part of a draconian
            population control policy by the government. The narrator agrees to
            transfer her consciousness, and they meet in the narrator’s dreams.
            But the dreamworld they’ve created is cold, and harsh, and
            nihilistic, and when the narrator is sent to cryosleep they decline
            to share consciousness, thinking people will be happier without them
            around.

            A woman travels to an uncanny, superficially pleasant planet. She
            finds herself surrounded by addicts and nostalgic for memories that
            don’t feel like hers. Everyone is desperately scrambling to keep
            what might already have been lost.

            Jane is interrupted at the arcade by an old woman who reminds him of
            his ex Reiko. We take a tour through their distant, drug-addled
            relationship: Jane’s cold indifference, Reiko’s addiction. The old
            woman <em>is</em> Reiko: they sit and talk and listen to music,
            wondering if things could’ve turned out differently.

            The relationship between an alien and a human is strained as their
            governments teeter on the edge of war. The alien and his comrades
            are afraid of Earth’s brutal expansionism and plan an escape. Both
            he and the human try to escape the inevitable, either literally or
            with substances.

            Two teenagers are adrift and unemployed in an automated police
            state. One has an implant that makes them want to watch TV — the
            other doesn’t need it, it’s all she has to do. After witnessing a
            murder they believe the only way to feel and connect is through
            violence.
