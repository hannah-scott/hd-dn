<p>A woman works as a receptionist in the South Korean border town of Sokcho during the off-season. When a comic book artist from France arrives, she develops feelings for him and tries to start a relationship — but he holds her and her country at arm’s reach. Reads well and quickly, I really enjoyed it.</p>    </div>
