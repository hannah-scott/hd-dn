<p>While visiting the home of some friends, Mr.Â Hastings not only witnesses a murder by poisoning but also runs into his friend, the acclaimed Belgian detective Poirot. Poirot and Hastings begin their investigation, with Hastings never quite seeing things as clearly as Poirot wishes. Offhand remarks which have aged rather poorly mar an otherwise very fun detective story.</p>    </div>
