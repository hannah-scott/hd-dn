<p>A young girl is taken from her home and stripped of her name and identity to serve the Nameless Gods of the Kargish empire. One day when walking through the pitch-black labyrinths that make up the godsâ€™ domain, she comes across a wizard thief seeking half of a great lost treasure that resides in the labyrinth. By speaking to him she learns more about the cultures the Kargish empire seek to conquer: she rebels against her cruel gods and escapes her cloistered, lonely fate.</p>
