<p>In a world of orphanages for magical children, a well-meaning but beaten-down social worker is sent to a home on a mysterious island to assess its inhabitants’ safety. But the children — and caretakers — he meets challenge all of his preconceived notion, and he begins to question how much good the system actually does. A book about overcoming bigotry, defining one’s self, and chosen families.</p>
