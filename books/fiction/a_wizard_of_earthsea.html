                            A young man discovers his knack for magic when he
                            saves the people of his village from an invading
                            force. He is sent to a school of magic, but in his
                            arrogance and haste to prove himself summons a dark
                            shadow of his own power which sets itself against
                            him. He flees across Earthsea to escape this shadow,
                            but as he travels and matures he learns to face up
                            to the consequences of his mistakes and vanquish the
                            nameless shadow.
