        <p class="author">Ursula K. Le Guin</p>
        <p>
            A young man discovers his knack for magic when he saves the people
            of his village from an invading force. He is sent to a school of
            magic, but in his arrogance and haste to prove himself summons a
            dark shadow of his own power which sets itself against him. He flees
            across Earthsea to escape this shadow, but as he travels and matures
            he learns to face up to the consequences of his mistakes and
            vanquish the nameless shadow.
