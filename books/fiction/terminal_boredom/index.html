<p>This is a selection of science fiction short stories published in Japan
between the 1960s and 1980s. Where I can find a publishing year I&rsquo;ve
included it.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-summaries">Chapter Summaries</h2>

<h3 id="women-and-women-1978">Women And Women (1978)</h3>

<p>The male population has declined as a result of pollution and war, and
all men are imprisoned at birth. One day, a girl sees a boy from out her
window; she starts a secret dialogue with him, knowing that it is
forbidden. He forces himself on her in an abandoned factory and is sent
back to the camps; the story ends with her wondering how she can live
knowing what she knows about men, and women.</p>

<p>I saw this described as &ldquo;ambivalent feminist separatism&rdquo; in a paper.</p>

<h3 id="you-may-dream">You May Dream</h3>

<p>The narrator&rsquo;s friend is put into cryosleep as part of a draconian
population control policy by the government. The narrator agrees to
transfer her consciousness, and they meet in the narrator&rsquo;s dreams. But
the dreamworld they&rsquo;ve created is cold, and harsh, and nihilistic, and
when the narrator is sent to cryosleep they decline to share
consciousness, thinking people will be happier without them around.</p>

<h3 id="that-old-seaside-club">That Old Seaside Club</h3>

<p>A woman travels to an uncanny, superficially pleasant planet. She finds
herself surrounded by addicts and nostalgic for memories that don&rsquo;t feel
like hers. Everyone is desperately scrambling to keep what might already
have been lost.</p>

<h3 id="smoke-gets-in-your-eyes">Smoke Gets In Your Eyes</h3>

<p>Jane is interrupted at the arcade by an old woman who reminds him of his
ex Reiko. We take a tour through their distant, drug-addled
relationship: Jane&rsquo;s cold indifference, Reiko&rsquo;s addiction. The old woman
<em>is</em> Reiko: they sit and talk and listen to music, wondering if things
could&rsquo;ve turned out differently.</p>

<h3 id="forgotten">Forgotten</h3>

<p>The relationship between an alien and a human is strained as their
governments teeter on the edge of war. The alien and his comrades are
afraid of Earth&rsquo;s brutal expansionism and plan an escape. Both he and
the human try to escape the inevitable, either literally or with
substances.</p>

<h3 id="terminal-boredom">Terminal Boredom</h3>

<p>Two teenagers are adrift and unemployed in an automated police state.
One has an implant that makes them want to watch TV &mdash; the other
doesn&rsquo;t need it, it&rsquo;s all she has to do. After witnessing a murder they
believe the only way to feel and connect is through violence.</p>
