 <p>A young man discovers his knack for magic when he saves the people of
his village from an invading force. He is sent to a school of magic, but
in his arrogance and haste to prove himself summons a dark shadow of his
own power which sets itself against him. He flees across Earthsea to
escape this shadow, but as he travels and matures he learns to face up
to the consequences of his mistakes and vanquish the nameless shadow.</p>
