<p>Really beautiful. I loved the central conceit of connectedness and interconnectedness between these different people, this sense of Britain being very large and very small – and the world, too. People coming from across the world, having room enough to live entire lives but not enough to avoid bumping into each other. This sort of idea of community, whether it’s actively searched out or completely unknown. Very moving book, I love this.</p>    </div>
