<p>Since 2020 I’ve kept notes on books I read. It helps me pay more attention to what I’m reading, and is a good resource when I’m trying to come up with recommendations for friends.</p>
<p>I use a “three-sentence summary” method that I picked up from <em>Atomic Habits</em>, with a pretty loose definition of “sentence”. For technical and some non-fiction books I summarise each chapter too.</p>
