        <h1 class="title">Tomorrow Sex Will Be Good Again</h1>
        <p class="author">Katherine Angel</p>

        <p>
            Katherine Angel posits that consent is not enough, that while
            positive consent is the “least bad standard” for sexual assault
            legislation, it isn't equipped to make “sex good again”. She is
            critical of <em>confidence culture</em>, the idea that a woman
            should be invulnerable and self-confident — either knowing her
            desires and giving positive consent, or boldly rebuffing any man who
            crosses her boundaries. She argues instead for a model of sexual
            assault that places responsibility with the assaulter; for
            recognition of the power dynamics and inequality inherent in sex;
            and for acceptance of women's (and men's) sexual vulnerability, and
            the pleasure that can be found in experimentation and uncertainty.

        <h3 id="on-consent">1. On Consent</h3>
        <p>
            Positive consent is the “least bad standard” for sexual assault
            legislation, but it cannot achieve the larger aim of consent culture
            — of making sex good again. Advocates both for and against positive
            consent use the language of
            <em>confidence</em>: either that women should know what they want
            and enthusiastically communicate it; or else should boldly stand up
            to any man who oversteps his mark. The latter position ignores the
            real imbalance of power in hetero sex; the former asks that women
            “know ourselves in order to be safe from violence”, and that desire
            be “fixed and known” before women can experience pleasure
        </p>
        <h3 id="on-desire">2. On Desire</h3>
        <p>Angel presents two contrasting views of sexual desire:</p>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>
                the Masters-Johnson 'linear' model of sex, where desire is a
                spontaneous biological drive for both men and women
            </li>
            <li>
                the theory that male desire is spontaneous, whereas women's is
                responsive and more driven by non-sexual needs
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            The first, she argues, is a shoddy medicalisation of a social
            phenomenon, while the latter places women in a passive role and can
            transform female desire into transactional motive. The reality is
            that both shaped by societal forces: female spontaneous desire is
            repressed and punished by society, while men's non-sexual motives
            are rendered invisible
        </p>
        <h3 id="on-arousal">3. On Arousal</h3>
        <p>
            Sex studies claim to identify what <em>really</em> arouses women by
            measuring for example vaginal blood flow, and have repeatedly found
            that women's subjective arousal is 'non-concordant' with these
            physical responses. This finding are troubling for two reasons:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                if positive consent and self-knowledge protect against sexual
                violence, what does it mean to not know what arouses you?
            </li>
            <li>
                if physical arousal is an indicator of
                <em>real</em> arousal, can a woman who is physically aroused
                during a sexual assault defend herself in court?
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            In measuring physical responses these experiments remove sex from
            its social reality: “it is not the case that sexual desire is
            occurring and women are disconnected from it; it's that what the
            laboratory is studying is not sexual arousal”
        </p>
        <h3 id="on-vulnerability">4. On Vulnerability</h3>
        <p>
            Consent and confidence culture position women as invulnerable,
            knowing full well their desires and needs and being able to
            communicate them clearly. This comes from a place of wanting to
            protect women from men who see uncertainty as something to be
            overcome — see 'no' as an invitation to push for a 'yes'. But sexual
            pleasure arises from vulnerability, from being both “met [… and]
            surprised in one's desires”: where consent reaches its limits, Angel
            advocates “conversation, mutual exploration, curiosity,
            uncertainty”.
