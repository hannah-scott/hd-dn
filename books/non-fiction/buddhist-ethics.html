        <h2 id="three-sentence-summary">Three Sentence Summary</h2>
        <p>
            The author manages, in a very short amount of space, to give an
            overview of the complexity of a Buddhist ethical style. He stresses
            that the stereotypical Western view of the Buddhist monk as an
            progressive humanitarian is overly simple and reductionist. While
            Buddhist principles can often align progressive movements and
            Buddhism, many Buddhists hold what we might consider conservative
            views and ethical questions are not universally decided.
        </p>
        <h2 id="chapter-summaries">Chapter Summaries</h2>
        <h3 id="buddhist-morality">1. Buddhist morality</h3>
        <p>
            The author begins with a condensed overview of the foundation of
            “mainstream” Buddhist morality. Some of this is familiar to Western
            readers:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>not killing</li>
            <li>not lying</li>
            <li>not stealing</li>
            <li>generosity</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Other concepts such as karma are more novel and their nuance can be
            easily misunderstood.
        </p>
        <h3 id="ethics-east-and-west">2. Ethics East and West</h3>
        <p>
            The author gives a summary of some Western ethical schools, namely:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>deontology</li>
            <li>utilitarianism</li>
            <li>virtue ethics</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Each of these contain similarities with what we might codify as
            “Buddhist ethics”, but fail to capture it completely: this is also
            true of what we might call “Christian ethics”. The concept of
            “rights-based ethics” is also touched on, namely that it is a
            controversial topic in a religion which rejects the concept of the
            self.
        </p>
        <h3 id="animals-and-the-environment">3. Animals and the environment</h3>
        <p>
            Buddhist prohibitions against violence and causing suffering seem to
            make the religion a natural ally to the modern environmental
            movement. However, Buddhism has a clear hierarachy which places
            humans above animals (anthrocentrism), and there are certain
            exceptions made around e.g. eating meat and domesticating livestock.
            The author stresses the philosophy’s complexity: it is a mistake to
            paint a simple rosy picture of Buddhists as enlightened
            environmentalists, or to assume that a Buddhist would agree with all
            concerns of the modern environmental movement.
        </p>
        <h3 id="sexuality-and-gender">4. Sexuality and gender</h3>
        <p>
            While there is a view in the West that Buddhism is more sexually
            permissive or progressive in Christinaity, the reality is that sex
            is commonly seen as “for procreation” by religious leaders and is
            generally considered a taboo topic. The Third Precept outlaws some
            sexual acts, but is not proscriptive: it is usually interepreted as
            covering sex crimes, incest and in some cases polygamy. The view on
            homosexuality &amp; trans issues seems in line with the modern
            Church of England, for example: tolerant but not supportive, and
            forbidding “practice” amongst monks.
        </p>
        <h3 id="war-violence-and-terrorism">5. War, violence and terrorism</h3>
        <p>Most classical Buddhist sources advocate non-violence, either as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>context-independent and always correct</li>
            <li>
                context-dependent, meaning violence can be sometimes permissible
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The author notes that the latter more pragmatic reading normally
            applies to states and authority figures: Buddhist states have laws,
            prisons, and armies, all of which exercise force and violence. Which
            Buddhism has been weaponised, it has been as part of an effort with
            the state to promote “religio-nationalism”, e.g.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Japanese Zen during WWII</li>
            <li>the Sri Lankan civil war</li>
            <li>the ethnic cleansing of Muslims and Christians in Myanmar</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="abortion">6. Abortion</h3>
        <p>The classical view on abortion is quite clear-cut:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                a foetus contains the reincarnated soul of a complete, reasoning
                being
            </li>
            <li>it is alive and complete from the moment of conception</li>
            <li>killing a human being is proscribed against</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The reality, however, is that monks who served as medical advisers
            would perform or procure abortions — although they would often be
            sanctioned for doing so. The status of abortion is quite restrictive
            in some Buddhist countries, although there is little protest or
            condemnation from monks as in Christian nations — partly due to
            compassion for people seeking abortions, and partly out of societal
            embarrassment.
        </p>
        <h3 id="suicide-and-euthanasia">7. Suicide and euthanasia</h3>
        <p>
            Buddhsim seems the clearly prohibit suicide, with the third monastic
            rule prohibiting taking human life explicitly mentioning suicide and
            assisted suicide. Thus Buddhism would prohibit euthanasia too, since
            it is generally accepted that death is karmically determined and
            euthanasia would therefore cause needless death. There is an
            acception made in the case that deah in inevitable: in the case of
            long, terminal illnesses it may be considered acceptable to not
            prolong suffering at great societal cost.
        </p>
        <h3 id="clones-cyborgs-and-singularities">
            8. Clones, cyborgs and singularities
        </h3>
        <p>
            Unlike Christianity, Buddhism does not per se have a problem with
            cloning (there is no God in whose image we are made), although it
            does raise interesting questions about where karma is allocated.
            Likewise, Buddhists might be quite sympathetic to transhumanist
            ideas of extending life, relieving pain and connecting consciounesss
            through technological means. However, the author reminds us that it
            is brevity that can give meaning to human life, as well as the
            contemplation of death, and that many historical techologies have
            failed to deliver on their promises of stopping the suffering that
            Buddhists consider a vital part of human life.
