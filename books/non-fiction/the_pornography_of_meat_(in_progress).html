<h1>The Pornography of Meat</h1>

<h2>Carol J. Adams</h2>

<h3>1. What Pornography?</h3>

<p>The chapter lists examples of the conflation of sexual exploitation of women
with meat consumption. Adams connects these two as consumptive: the use of
some-<em>thing</em> by some-<em>one</em>. She relates the design of pornography to that of
advertising, noting that looking at pornography is essentially reinforcement of
arousal cues.</p>

<h3>2. More Than Meat</h3>

<p>Adams defines a formula for the <em>absent referent</em>:</p>

<p>a body, human or animal + butchering = &ldquo;meat&rdquo;, consumable, destruction of
subject status.</p>

<p>She makes the point that &lsquo;meat&rsquo;, &lsquo;beef&rsquo; etc. are abstracted terms &mdash; that by
butchering an animal we remove its status as some-<em>one</em>. She then compares this
to the way in which pornography abstracts and recontextualises body parts,
&lsquo;butchering&rsquo; the body of (typically) a woman with a lens and turning them into
consumable objects.</p>

<h3>3. Man To Man</h3>

<p>The &ldquo;public voice&rdquo; of that advertising and everyday speech uses is explicitly a
male voice. Both portray meat-eating, sexual objectification of woman and
social dominance: they server as a &ldquo;male call&rdquo; that vocalises and confirms the
consumer&rsquo;s identity. In this way, meat + sex + violence (all active actions
taken against some other) become points of social bonding between men.</p>

<h3>4. Yoked Oppression</h3>

<p>Advertising depicts social relations as a zero-sum hierarchy, advancing the
dominance of some-<em>one</em> over some-<em>thing</em>. This is illustrated by Adams with
the A/NOT A duality, which is implicitly a hierarchy:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>A</th>
<th>NOT A</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>MAN</td>
<td>WOMAN</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>WHITE</td>
<td>PERSON OF COLOUR</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>HUMAN</td>
<td>ANIMAL</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>These NOT A objectified groups a &ldquo;yoked&rdquo; together in advertisement imaging,
reinforcing each other&rsquo;s object status and the social dominance of the &ldquo;A&rdquo;.</p>
