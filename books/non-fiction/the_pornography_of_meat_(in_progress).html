<h1 id="the-pornography-of-meat">The Pornography of Meat</h1>
<h2 id="carol-j.-adams">Carol J. Adams</h2>
<h3 id="what-pornography">1. What Pornography?</h3>
<p>The chapter lists examples of the conflation of sexual exploitation of women with meat consumption. Adams connects these two as consumptive: the use of some-<em>thing</em> by some-<em>one</em>. She relates the design of pornography to that of advertising, noting that looking at pornography is essentially reinforcement of arousal cues.</p>
<h3 id="more-than-meat">2. More Than Meat</h3>
<p>Adams defines a formula for the <em>absent referent</em>:</p>
<p>a body, human or animal + butchering = “meat”, consumable, destruction of subject status.</p>
<p>She makes the point that ‘meat’, ‘beef’ etc. are abstracted terms — that by butchering an animal we remove its status as some-<em>one</em>. She then compares this to the way in which pornography abstracts and recontextualises body parts, ‘butchering’ the body of (typically) a woman with a lens and turning them into consumable objects.</p>
<h3 id="man-to-man">3. Man To Man</h3>
<p>The “public voice” of that advertising and everyday speech uses is explicitly a male voice. Both portray meat-eating, sexual objectification of woman and social dominance: they server as a “male call” that vocalises and confirms the consumer’s identity. In this way, meat + sex + violence (all active actions taken against some other) become points of social bonding between men.</p>
<h3 id="yoked-oppression">4. Yoked Oppression</h3>
<p>Advertising depicts social relations as a zero-sum hierarchy, advancing the dominance of some-<em>one</em> over some-<em>thing</em>. This is illustrated by Adams with the A/NOT A duality, which is implicitly a hierarchy:</p>
<table>

<tr class="header">
<th>A</th>

<tr class="odd">
<td>MAN</td>
<td>WOMAN</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>WHITE</td>
<td>PERSON OF COLOUR</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>HUMAN</td>
<td>ANIMAL</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>These NOT A objectified groups a “yoked” together in advertisement imaging, reinforcing each other’s object status and the social dominance of the “A”.</p>
