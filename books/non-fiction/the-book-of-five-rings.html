            In many areas of life, but particularly martial arts, an
            overemphasis is placed on technique, showmanship and equipment. The
            martial arts that Musashi<a

            teach are simple, direct and practical. One should keep a calm,
            clear mind and act without personal biases, choosing one's actions
            swiftly and precisely to bring about victory.
        </p>
        <h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
        <p>
            Musashi details his dueling life: more than sixty victorious duels
            between the ages of 13 and 29. At 30, he realises that his victories
            were not due to “consummate attainment of martial arts” but
            something else, an insight into a deeper martial science. He spends
            the rest of his life investigating and systematising that insight,
            and this book is the result.

            The way of the warrior is not to be ready to die — all artisans give
            up their lives to a particular craft — but rather the drive to
            “excel others in anything and everything”. One should try to
            “distinguish the superficial from the substantial” and prefer
            practical professionalism over commercial showmanship. Like a
            carpenter, the martial artist must learn to make prudent use of the
            correct tool for the job, following these rules:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <ol type="1">
                <li>Think of what is right and true.</li>
                <li>Practice and cultivate the science.</li>
                <li>Become acquainted with the arts.</li>
                <li>Know the principles of the crafts.</li>
                <li>Understand the harm and benefit in everything.</li>
                <li>Learn to see everything accurately.</li>
                <li>Become aware of what is not obvious.</li>
                <li>Be careful even in small matters.</li>
                <li>Do not do anything useless.</li>
            </ol>
        </blockquote>
        <h2 id="the-water-scroll">The Water Scroll</h2>
        <p>
            Stress is put on the state of mind of the martial artist: one should
            remain as calm as in everyday life, focusing on relaxing the mind
            and letting go of subjective biases. With good battle posture too,
            the martial art should be fully integrated into your life: you
            should “make your ordinary bearing the bearing you use in martial
            arts” and vice versa. Musashi contrasts hitting or “feeling out”
            your opponent with striking:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                Even if you hit an opponent so hard that he dies on the spot,
                this is a hit. A strike is when you consciously and deliberately
                strike the blow you intend to strike.
            </p>
        </blockquote>
        <h2 id="the-fire-scroll">The Fire Scroll</h2>
        <p>
            Musashi emphasises fighting “with the sun at your back”, using every
            advantage possible and inhibiting all your opponent's moves at their
            very outset. He encourages putting yourself in an opponent's shoes,
            thinking carefully about the psychological state they are in when
            facing off against you. Giving off a relaxed mood, you can infect
            your opponent with that same calm and put them at ease — then strike
            when the critical moment arises: maintaining internal calm,
            disrupting your opponent's mood, then suddenly making a vital strike
            is at the heart of Musashi's psychology.

            This chapter focuses on the flaws of subjective bias in other
            martial schools: the correct way is the ordinary way which works,
            clear and direct. Subtle emphasis is put on the aesthetics of
            correct technique: for example,
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                The performance of an expert seems relaxed but does not leave
                any gaps. The actions of trained people do not seem rushed.
            </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            The way is understanding the relative merits and flaws of all
            techniques, and without bias choosing the right path ahead.
        </p>
        <h2 id="the-scroll-of-emptiness">The Scroll of Emptiness</h2>
        <p>
            Lack of knowledge is not emptiness. Rather, through diligent,
            consistent study and practice one finds “there is no obscurity, and
            the clouds of confusion have cleared away”. The goal is thoughtless,
            unbiased action: this is emptiness, and is the way.
