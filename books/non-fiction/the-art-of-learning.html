        <h1 class="title">The Art of Learning</h1>
        <p class="author">Josh Waitzkin</p>

        <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
        <p>
            The book is partly an overview of Waitzkin's successful careers as a
            high-level chess player and martial artist, partly a philosophical
            treatise on the nature of learning.
        </p>
        <p>
            One theme he comes back to a lot is shared patterns and
            commonalities between different disciplines, which rang true to me â€”
            as did his insistence that mastery is a very advanced application of
            the basics.
        </p>
        <p>
            His ideas around time dilation were less compelling, and while I
            found the practical advice interesting and might apply some of it in
            my own learning there just wasn't enough of it for me.
