                            Katherine Angel posits that consent is not enough,
                            that while positive consent is the &ldquo;least bad
                            standard&rdquo; for sexual assault legislation, it
                            isn&rsquo;t equipped to make &ldquo;sex good
                            again&rdquo;. She is critical of
                            <em>confidence culture</em>, the idea that a woman
                            should be invulnerable and self-confident &mdash;
                            either knowing her desires and giving positive
                            consent, or boldly rebuffing any man who crosses her
                            boundaries. She argues instead for a model of sexual
                            assault that places responsibility with the
                            assaulter; for recognition of the power dynamics and
                            inequality inherent in sex; and for acceptance of
                            women&rsquo;s (and men&rsquo;s) sexual
                            vulnerability, and the pleasure that can be found in
                            experimentation and uncertainty.

                            Positive consent is the &ldquo;least bad
                            standard&rdquo; for sexual assault legislation, but
                            it cannot achieve the larger aim of consent culture
                            &mdash; of making sex good again. Advocates both for
                            and against positive consent use the language of
                            <em>confidence</em>: either that women should know
                            what they want and enthusiastically communicate it;
                            or else should boldly stand up to any man who
                            oversteps his mark. The latter position ignores the
                            real imbalance of power in hetero sex; the former
                            asks that women &ldquo;know ourselves in order to be
                            safe from violence&rdquo;, and that desire be
                            &ldquo;fixed and known&rdquo; before women can

                            <li>
                                the Masters-Johnson &lsquo;linear&rsquo; model
                                of sex, where desire is a spontaneous biological
                                drive for both men and women
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                the theory that male desire is spontaneous,
                                whereas women&rsquo;s is responsive and more
                                driven by non-sexual needs

                            The first, she argues, is a shoddy medicalisation of
                            a social phenomenon, while the latter places women
                            in a passive role and can transform female desire
                            into transactional motive. The reality is that both
                            shaped by societal forces: female spontaneous desire
                            is repressed and punished by society, while
                            men&rsquo;s non-sexual motives are rendered

                        <p class="my-1">
                            Sex studies claim to identify what
                            <em>really</em> arouses women by measuring for
                            example vaginal blood flow, and have repeatedly
                            found that women&rsquo;s subjective arousal is
                            &lsquo;non-concordant&rsquo; with these physical
                            responses. This finding are troubling for two
                            reasons:
                        </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                if positive consent and self-knowledge protect
                                against sexual violence, what does it mean to
                                not know what arouses you?
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                if physical arousal is an indicator of
                                <em>real</em> arousal, can a woman who is
                                physically aroused during a sexual assault
                                defend herself in court?
                            </li>

                            In measuring physical responses these experiments
                            remove sex from its social reality: &ldquo;it is not
                            the case that sexual desire is occurring and women
                            are disconnected from it; it&rsquo;s that what the
                            laboratory is studying is not sexual arousal&rdquo;

                            Consent and confidence culture position women as
                            invulnerable, knowing full well their desires and
                            needs and being able to communicate them clearly.
                            This comes from a place of wanting to protect women
                            from men who see uncertainty as something to be
                            overcome &mdash; see &lsquo;no&rsquo; as an
                            invitation to push for a &lsquo;yes&rsquo;. But
                            sexual pleasure arises from vulnerability, from
                            being both &ldquo;met [&hellip; and] surprised in
                            one&rsquo;s desires&rdquo;: where consent reaches
                            its limits, Angel advocates &ldquo;conversation,
                            mutual exploration, curiosity, uncertainty&rdquo;.
