        <p>
            Part biography, part political work: Akala explores the intersection
            of race and class in the UK through the lens of his own experiences
            growing up and the politics inherent in all actions.
        </p>
        <p>
            By exploring not only the history of the British empire and its
            interactions/extractionist invasions of its “holdings”, but also
            Japanese and other empires and the changing notions of whiteness and
            race through history, he emphasises the constructed nature of race
            and its role in preserving white supremacist power structures.
        </p>
        <p>
            Particularly in a heavily class-divided nation like Britain, the
            class/race intersection can lead to damaging assumptions being made
            — that he's writing mostly about childhood and early adulthood
            highlights the ways in which we're shaped by the perceptions and
            behaviour of the people in immediate authority over us, such as
            teachers and school administrators.
