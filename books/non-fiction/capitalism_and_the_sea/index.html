<p>In Marx&rsquo;s conception of industrial capitalism as</p>

<ol>
<li>Exploitative and alienating production of goods</li>
<li>The realisation of value through trade and the resulting
accumulation of capital</li>
</ol>

<p>the sea is both a site of production (fishing) and a medium for
circulation (shipping). Capitalists exploit both, choosing their own
labour laws either through historical imperialism or modern flags of
convenience, whilst continuing unsustainable fishing practices with the
EEZ. Capitalism has been shaped by the sea (e.g. weather as a barrier to
trade), whilst also shaping it (e.g. land reclamation or ocean
acidification): this is a terraqueous relationship, the result of
applying land-based property rights onto the sea.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-summaries">Chapter Summaries</h2>

<h2 id="0-a-terraqueous-predicament">0: A Terraqueous Predicament</h2>

<p>The history of capitalism is intertwined with the geo-history of the
sea, forming a terraqueous (land-and-sea) relationship. The sea has been
a medium for shipping and oppression, resource extraction and waste
disposal. The physical features of it have been as moulded by capital as
capital has been shaped by those same features.</p>

<h2 id="1-circulation">1. Circulation</h2>

<p>The development of Marx&rsquo;s &ldquo;real&rdquo; industrial capitalism is a result of:</p>

<ol>
<li>Class conflict, exploitative and alienating production</li>
<li>Circulation of produced goods, realisation of value, and capital
accumulation</li>
</ol>

<p>The role of the sea in early commercial capitalism was to speed up
circulation and value realisation through shipping. In England and
Amsterdam, profits were reinvested and a network of industries and
financial services were created to feed this trade.</p>

<h2 id="2-order">2. Order</h2>

<p>The history of imposing order on the sea can be divided into three
distinct eras:</p>

<ol>
<li>The first notion of &ldquo;freedom of the sea&rdquo;, coexisting with piracy and
privateering</li>
<li>Global &lsquo;new navalism&rsquo; and the sea as a battleground between emerging
capitalist nations</li>
<li>Enclosure through international treaties against the backdrop of the
Cold War</li>
</ol>

<p>From its inception, &ldquo;freedom of the sea&rdquo; has been used to justify
profiteering and capitalist exploitation in disputed waters. The current
US position of control through international convention has been an
effective neo-colonial tool, but is ineffective in combatting piracy or
the weaponisation of the EEZ in the South China Sea.</p>

<h2 id="3-exploitation">3. Exploitation</h2>

<p>Exploitation &mdash; extracting surplus value from labourers &mdash; is uniquely
predatory and pervasive at sea. Shipowners:</p>

<ul>
<li>use <em>flags of convenience</em> to get around labour laws and high taxes</li>
<li>suppress costs through <em>labour arbitrage</em>, hiring cheap labour from
countries with lower wages</li>
</ul>

<p>Maritime labour plays a key role in the history of labour organisation,
but have have a history of racist &ldquo;white unionism&rdquo; and nationalist
ignorance to working conditions of foreign labourers.</p>

<h2 id="4-appropriation">4. Appropriation</h2>

<p>Fishing is an interesting study in the terraqueous nature of capital,
since how an animal is fished is contingent on its biology (e.g.
deep-sea fishing of highly migratory fish). At the same time,
capitalists have extended land-based ideas of property rights to the sea
using the idea of the EEZ. Historically and today, the discovery of new
fishing regions from which private capital profits has been funded by
public exploratory expeditions.</p>

<h2 id="5-logistics">5. Logistics</h2>

<p>Logistics in shipping is mainly concerned with the ability to <em>plan
ahead</em>, to know what will be where, when. The early dominance of coal
over wind is an example of accepting greater costs in exchange for
reliability. The just-in-time nature (a feature of planning and profit
chasing) makes the system more vulnerable to labour action, making
control an integral part of modern shipping.</p>

<h2 id="6-offshore">6. Offshore</h2>

<p>Through its &ldquo;remoteness, immensity, seclusion and fluidity,&rdquo; the sea has
become a place for capital to offshore elements and secure the dominant
social order. Some of examples of this:</p>

<ul>
<li>tax havens and secrecy jurisdictions</li>
<li>seasteading and islands for the ultra-rich</li>
<li>more negatively, prison islands</li>
<li>dumping waste</li>
<li>nuclear weapons testing</li>
</ul>

<p>A counterexample is global and oceanic warming, which cannot be
offshored due to its global nature and which represents a terraqueous
threat to human life.</p>

<h2 id="7-terraqueous-horizons">7. Terraqueous Horizons</h2>

<p>Seafaring is not inherently progressive, but contains potential for the
realisation of an international anticapitalist cosmopolitanism. In order
to achieve this, labour organisations would have to set aside their
dominating attitudes (racism) and exploit the fragility of modern
logistics networks. The terraqueous conception of freedom and stability,
innovation and regulation, is thus a model for how our anticapitalist
future could be built: the sea moulds us as we mould it.</p>
