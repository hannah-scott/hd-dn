<p>I read this before I started doing chapter summaries, but I got a lot from this book and it is well worth the time.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Our happiness is largely determined by the stories we tell ourselves after the fact, Daniel Kahneman’s <em>remembering self</em>. The Stoics offer two suggestions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>It is my own judgement that is causing my suffering, and I have the power to change that judgement now</li>
<li>Don’t try to change things that I cannot control</li>
</ol>
<p>Tools to help with suffering are talking to myself, not adding to first impressions, premeditating the loss of things I hold dear, and asking myself, “Do I have a problem <em>right now</em>?”</p>
