<h2>Three Sentence Summary</h2>

<p>Our happiness is largely determined by the stories we tell ourselves
after the fact, Daniel Kahneman&rsquo;s <em>remembering self</em>. The Stoics offer
two suggestions:</p>

<ol>
<li>It is my own judgement that is causing my suffering, and I have the
power to change that judgement now</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t try to change things that I cannot control</li>
</ol>


<p>Tools to help with suffering are talking to myself, not adding to first
impressions, premeditating the loss of things I hold dear, and asking
myself, &ldquo;Do I have a problem <em>right now</em>?&rdquo;</p>

<p><em><strong>NB:</strong> I read this before I started doing chapter summaries.</em></p>
