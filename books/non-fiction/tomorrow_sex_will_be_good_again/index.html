<p>Katherine Angel posits that consent is not enough, that while positive
consent is the &ldquo;least bad standard&rdquo; for sexual assault legislation, it
isn&rsquo;t equipped to make &ldquo;sex good again&rdquo;. She is critical of <em>confidence
culture</em>, the idea that a woman should be invulnerable and
self-confident &mdash; either knowing her desires and giving positive
consent, or boldly rebuffing any man who crosses her boundaries. She
argues instead for a model of sexual assault that places responsibility
with the assaulter; for recognition of the power dynamics and inequality
inherent in sex; and for acceptance of women&rsquo;s (and men&rsquo;s) sexual
vulnerability, and the pleasure that can be found in experimentation and
uncertainty.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-summaries">Chapter Summaries</h2>

<h3 id="1-on-consent">1. On Consent</h3>

<p>Positive consent is the &ldquo;least bad standard&rdquo; for sexual assault
legislation, but it cannot achieve the larger aim of consent culture &mdash;
of making sex good again. Advocates both for and against positive
consent use the language of <em>confidence</em>: either that women should know
what they want and enthusiastically communicate it; or else should
boldly stand up to any man who oversteps his mark. The latter position
ignores the real imbalance of power in hetero sex; the former asks that
women &ldquo;know ourselves in order to be safe from violence&rdquo;, and that
desire be &ldquo;fixed and known&rdquo; before women can experience pleasure</p>

<h3 id="2-on-desire">2. On Desire</h3>

<p>Angel presents two contrasting views of sexual desire:</p>

<ol>
<li>the Masters-Johnson &lsquo;linear&rsquo; model of sex, where desire is a
spontaneous biological drive for both men and women</li>
<li>the theory that male desire is spontaneous, whereas women&rsquo;s is
responsive and more driven by non-sexual needs</li>
</ol>

<p>The first, she argues, is a shoddy medicalisation of a social
phenomenon, while the latter places women in a passive role and can
transform female desire into transactional motive. The reality is that
both shaped by societal forces: female spontaneous desire is repressed
and punished by society, while men&rsquo;s non-sexual motives are rendered
invisible</p>

<h3 id="3-on-arousal">3. On Arousal</h3>

<p>Sex studies claim to identify what <em>really</em> arouses women by measuring
for example vaginal blood flow, and have repeatedly found that women&rsquo;s
subjective arousal is &lsquo;non-concordant&rsquo; with these physical responses.
This finding are troubling for two reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>if positive consent and self-knowledge protect against sexual
violence, what does it mean to not know what arouses you?</li>
<li>if physical arousal is an indicator of <em>real</em> arousal, can a woman
who is physically aroused during a sexual assault defend herself in
court?</li>
</ul>

<p>In measuring physical responses these experiments remove sex from its
social reality: &ldquo;it is not the case that sexual desire is occurring and
women are disconnected from it; it&rsquo;s that what the laboratory is
studying is not sexual arousal&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="4-on-vulnerability">4. On Vulnerability</h3>

<p>Consent and confidence culture position women as invulnerable, knowing
full well their desires and needs and being able to communicate them
clearly. This comes from a place of wanting to protect women from men
who see uncertainty as something to be overcome &mdash; see &lsquo;no&rsquo; as an
invitation to push for a &lsquo;yes&rsquo;. But sexual pleasure arises from
vulnerability, from being both &ldquo;met [&hellip; and] surprised in one&rsquo;s
desires&rdquo;: where consent reaches its limits, Angel advocates
&ldquo;conversation, mutual exploration, curiosity, uncertainty&rdquo;.</p>
