        <h1 class="title">The Emancipated Spectator</h1>
        <p class="author">Jacques Rancière</p>

        <p>
            The book is a ‘critique of’ critique of the spectacle, described as
            the belief that the bombardment of images and spectacles has
            rendered democractic subjects passive and ignorant. Rancière sees
            this as a reaction to the breakdown of cause and effect in artistic
            intent, and relates it to the Victorian idea that the “fragile
            brains” of poor people were too easily influenced by and unable to
            comprehend consumer society. He argues that spectators are
            inherently active participants who interpret and recontextualise
            what they see to <em>create</em> meaning, and thus that art can map
            out a new ‘topography’ of possibilities for society
            <em>regardless of the artist’s intent</em>.

        <p>
            The paradox of the spectator is defined thus: theatre cannot exist
            without spectators, but spectators are necessarily passive and
            ignorant. Theatrical theory has approached this paradox in two
            contrasting ways:
        </p>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>
                The spectator must be given distance to observe, digest and
                learn from the spectacle (Brecht)
            </li>
            <li>
                Distance must be abolished, the spectator made part of the
                spectacle itself and granted the ability to act (Artaud)
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            By using the metaphor of an ignorant schoolmaster who teaches
            “something that [he] does not know himself”, Rancière argues that
            the spectator is necessarily an active participant, interpreting
            what they see in the context of their existing knowledge.

            2. The Misadventures of Critical Thought
        </h3>
        <p>
            Critical thought is exemplified by ironic melancholy on the left and
            fervent anti-democracy on the right, both arguing that any attempt
            to combat their “beast” merely empowers it. This comes from the
            Victorian belief that the “fragile brains” of poor people are
            incapable of comprehending consumer society: that they “do not know
            how to transform acquired knowledge into activist energy”. An
            emancipatory critique should instead try to break from this pattern,
            allowing for <em>dissensus</em> and the vision and action of people
            otherwise thought of as “without qualities”.

            3. Aesthetic Separation, Aesthetic Community
        </h3>
        <p>
            Through examples from art and philosophy the author attempts to
            sketch a shape of a dissensual “aesthetic community”. A point that
            comes up repeatedly is the separation between artistic intent and
            form, and the audience’s political understanding of a work. Two
            examples are given of the indirectly political nature of art:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                the floorlayer who finds shared humanity and new passions in
                reading romantic heroic fiction
            </li>
            <li>
                the director of <em>In Vanda’s Room</em>, a deeply aesthetic
                film about the lives of poor drug addicts whose stories may only
                be seen by the “film-buff elite”
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="the-intolerable-image">4. The Intolerable Image</h3>
        <p>
            The classical use of intolerable images is: seeing the image prompts
            political understanding in me, and so I take action to stop this
            thing. Critique of the spectacle privileges the voice over images,
            positing that the bombardment of intolerable images has failed to
            cause political action because democratic individuals lack the
            knowledge to understand them. The author instead argues that images
            can be political tools: they “do not supply weapons for battle”, but
            “perhaps” create a new and unintended landscape of understandings
            and possibilities in their audiences.
        </p>
        <h3 id="the-pensive-image">5. The Pensive Image</h3>
        <p>
            A pensive image is a transitory one, one that draws attention to the
            “zone of indeterminacy between thought and non-thought, activity and
            passivity, […] art and non-art”. The aesthetic break from
            representational art is often described as the “happy model of the
            autonomy of art” free from representation, or else the “tragic model
            of the ‘sublime’” where ideas are divorced from reality. Against
            this is the pensive image, representational yet having “tension
            between several nodes of representation” and resisting clear
            understanding.
