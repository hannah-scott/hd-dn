<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>The book is partly an overview of Waitzkin&rsquo;s successful careers as a
high-level chess player and martial artist, partly a philosophical
treatise on the nature of learning.</p>

<p>One theme he comes back to a lot is shared patterns and commonalities
between different disciplines, which rang true to me &mdash; as did his
insistence that mastery is a very advanced application of the basics.</p>

<p>His ideas around time dilation were less compelling, and while I found
the practical advice interesting and might apply some of it in my own
learning there just wasn&rsquo;t enough of it for me.</p>
