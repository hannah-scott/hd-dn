        <p>
            Bayley argues that aesthetic enjoyment of physical objects and
            pastimes is being neglected in favour or a more detached engagement
            with digital tech — in a series of loosely connected short essays,
            he lays out a rough sketch of what a “hedonistic” life might
            contain:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>time spent in nature and around good art</li>
            <li>mindful enjoyment simple pleasures</li>
            <li>money spent well on pieces that last</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            He seems somewhat uninterested in physical pleasure and sex as a
            physical act, often favouring intellectual engagement over simple
            “pleasure”, which grates against my own stance. I also found his
            tone somewhat pretentious and self-important, and while a lot of the
            book was entertaining by the end I was growing a bit tired of him.
