<p>Bayley argues that aesthetic enjoyment of physical objects and pastimes is being neglected in favour or a more detached engagement with digital tech — in a series of loosely connected short essays, he lays out a rough sketch of what a “hedonistic” life might contain:</p>
<ul>
<li>time spent in nature and around good art</li>
<li>mindful enjoyment simple pleasures</li>
<li>money spent well on pieces that last</li>
</ul>
<p>He seems somewhat uninterested in physical pleasure and sex as a physical act, often favouring intellectual engagement over simple “pleasure”, which grates against my own stance. I also found his tone somewhat pretentious and self-important, and while a lot of the book was entertaining by the end I was growing a bit tired of him.</p>    </div>
