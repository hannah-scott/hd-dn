            A far less radical book than I was expecting, and more convincing
            because of it. I suspect a lot of people would be turned off or
            inflamed by the title, but the arguments inside seem like they would
            be entirely reasonable to most liberals concerned about police
            brutality.

            Rather than calling for an end to the police, Vitale is calling for
            an end to policing as the only solution to societal problems. He
            argues that using the carceral state and policing to manage these
            problems is not only overly violent and immoral in most cases, but
            makes them worse by removing the rights of legal recourse from
            people.
        </p>

            Instead, he is pretty consistent in his thesis that better jobs and
            affordable long-term housing would solve most of societies problems.
            He offers up lots of examples of cheaper and evidence-based
            solutions to the problems that the police claim to solve. I don't
            think it would convince a die-hard neoconservative of anything at
            all, but might be very compelling to a broadly left person.
