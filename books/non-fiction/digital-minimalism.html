<h1 class="title">Digital Minimalism</h1>

<p>Modern technology, in particular smartphone apps, are often designed explicitly to highjack attention for the purpose of making money and serving ads: they are designed to be addictive.</p>
<p>Newport proposes that we should develop a <strong>philosophy of technology use</strong>, believing this can help us to make more informed and less compulsive decisions about tech use: he advocates <strong>digital minimalism</strong>, using technology in an “optimised” way to achieve defined goals.</p>
<p>He suggests a 30-day “digital declutter”, essentially a digital fast during which we try to reconnect with and identify activities that bring us deep joy and meaning; following this, we can begin to reintroduce technology back into our lives with strict <strong>operating procedures</strong> rooted in our philosophies.</p>    </div>
