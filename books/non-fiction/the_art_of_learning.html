<h1 class="title">The Art of Learning</h1>
<p class="author">Josh Waitzkin</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>The book is partly an overview of Waitzkin’s successful careers as a high-level chess player and martial artist, partly a philosophical treatise on the nature of learning.</p>
<p>One theme he comes back to a lot is shared patterns and commonalities between different disciplines, which rang true to me — as did his insistence that mastery is a very advanced application of the basics.</p>
<p>His ideas around time dilation were less compelling, and while I found the practical advice interesting and might apply some of it in my own learning there just wasn’t enough of it for me.</p>
