        <p>
            Luddism has been unfairly painted as technophobic; in reality it
            identified that technology is a <em>political</em> tool used to
            control and exploit labour, that can and should be resisted. The
            accelerationist left and pro-automation union leaders have been more
            concerned with how technology <em>could</em> help the worker of the
            future, than how it is making people's lives worse <em>now</em>. The
            reality of automation in the workplace has always been one of
            fractioning, alienation and control, resisted repeatedly by workers
            through labour organising, machine-breaking and ingenious sabotage.

        <p>
            The prevailing attitude on the centre and right, as well as the
            accelerationist left, is that progress (or liberation) is synonymous
            with and achieved through technological development. The Luddite
            argument is that technology is anti-progress, in that
            capitalist-produced technology can <em>only</em> further the goals
            of capital. “[T]o be a good Marxist is to also be a Luddite”, and a
            Luddite trend exists throughout labour movements to the present day.

        <p>
            Rather than technophobia, Luddism is the recognition that technology
            is <em>political</em>, and that it should be opposed when used by
            capital to exploit and fragment labour. Historical Luddism can
            therefore be considered a proto-organised labour movement revolting
            against their growing exploitation under proto-capitalism.
            Accelerationist leftism is antithetical to Marxism as a theory of
            struggle, since at its worst it posits that post-work socialism can
            be achieved without class conflict through technological innovation
            and automation.

            The Second International wanted capitalism to fully develop and
            advocated capitalist technological growth, seeing socialism as a
            necessary consequence of advanced capitalism's inherent
            contradictions. Taylorism — monitoring and enforcing workers'
            individual actions under the guise of improving efficiency — was for
            this reason championed by some on the left, including the
            governments of Lenin and Stalin. Meanwhile Taylorism was
            <em>actually</em> controlling and exploiting labour: the IWW
            advocated existing sabotage practices among workers as part of a
            broader class struggle.

        <h3 id="against-automation">3. Against Automation</h3>
        <p>
            Automation in the last century has polarised labour, increasing the
            risk and pace for the lowest-paid workers while generating more and
            more wealth for bosses. Those at the greatest risk of both
            unemployment and overwork are invariably those with the least power,
            such as black Americans during the Civil Rights era, and women
            working as telephone operator. But from ports to mines to factories,
            unions have consistently bought into automation's false promises of
            higher wages and shorter hours, leaving it up to workers to engage
            in wildcat strikes and sabotage the new machines.

        <h3 id="high-tech-luddism">4. High-Tech Luddism</h3>
        <p>
            Computers have been used throughout their history to reorganise
            labour through automation and abstraction and surveil and control by
            collecting vast amounts of data. The response of some workers and
            hackers has been characteristically Luddish:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                sabotage, through either direct damage, slowdown or fraudulent
                data entry
            </li>
            <li>
                the Free Software movement as a way to decommoditise software
                and regain control over one's work
            </li>
            <li>the use of Tor and other anti-surveillance technologies</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The proliferation of technology like self-checkouts and the ubiquity
            of data collection has blurred the lines of work and leisure,
            generating value for capitalists from every interaction.

        <h3 id="conclusion">5. Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
            Decelerationism is not a return to some “state of nature” or a “slow
            lifestyle”: it is the
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                manifestation of an antagonism towards the progress of the
                elites at the expense of the rest of us [… i]t is a wrench in
                the gears.
            </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Luddism as a political movement therefore:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>emphasises autonomy</li>
            <li>views technology as a site of struggle</li>
            <li>rejects “efficiency” as an end in itself</li>
            <li>is antagonist to existing capitalist social relations</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            It is concerned with articulating <em>how things are</em>, how work
            is made worst through technology, and what workers are doing and can
            do to resist and change the world for the better.
