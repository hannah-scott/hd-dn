            Interesting left history of the BBC. Makes its points very strongly
            at times, at others seems like a list of quotations. Admittedly
            these quotations are in themselves damning.

            The structure is strong: beginning with fundamental institutional
            imbalances (foundational anti-communism, hiring being in bed with
            MI5) but around the middle the tone shifts to less of a “BBC
            willingly in bed with the state” and more of a “BBC acquiescing to
            the demands of the state” vibe. I suppose the point is that the
            heads have always been on the side of the establishment, whereas the
            rank and file journalists and engineers and such are just doing jobs
            and having establishment agendas forced upon them.

        <p>Bonus points for referring to it as the Falklands/Malvinas war.</p>
