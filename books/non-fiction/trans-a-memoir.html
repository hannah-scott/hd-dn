        <p class="author">Juliet Jacques</p>

        <p>
            Juliet writes the story of her transition in two parts &mdash; the
            personal and the political, which she emphasises are the same.
            Breaking up her day-to-day social interactions, living paycheck to
            paycheck while coming to terms with her identity, are essays of
            theory and how she sees the meaning of "transness" to extend far
            beyond the typical narrative that focuses solely on a change in
            appearance and body. Trans identities are often politicised without
            our consent: radically accepting that politicisation, and using it
            to serve our wider goals, certainly seems a viable option.
