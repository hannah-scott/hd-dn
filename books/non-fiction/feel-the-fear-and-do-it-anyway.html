        <p>
            Susan Jeffers provides a number of useful models for understanding
            <em>why</em> we are afraid, and how to act <em>despite</em> our
            fear. She believes that fear is an essential and universal part of
            growth, and that rather than trying to avoid fear we should embrace
            it as evidence that we are making progress towards a higher goal.
            She delves into her own spiritual beliefs and the law of attraction,
            which I personally found uncompelling.

            I didn't write summaries for the introductory and closing chapters.

        <h3 id="what-are-you-afraid-of-and-why">
            1. What Are You Afraid of… and Why?
        </h3>
        <p>Fears are broken down into three levels:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Level 1: things that happen to us or require action (losing a
                job)
            </li>
            <li>Level 2: ego-centric fears (rejection)</li>
            <li>Level 3: I can't handle it.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Jeffers' program attacks this deep level 3 fear: if I know I can
            handle whatever happens, I have nothing to fear. The way to this
            knowledge is by practicing self-belief and building up a body of
            evidence.
        </p>
        <h3 id="cant-you-make-it-go-away">2. Can't You Make It Go Away?</h3>
        <p>
            Jeffers says that fear is an intrinsic part of life, and that any
            growth is always accompanied by fear. We shouldn't try to get rid of
            fear, since then we would stop growing: rather, we should practice
            acting <em>despite</em> being afraid. She believes that pushing
            through this fear is better than living with the “fear that comes
            from a feeling of helplessness”.
        </p>
        <h3 id="from-pain-to-power">3. From Pain to Power</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>NB:</strong> I loved this chapter, I use this model a lot.
        </p>
        <p>
            We can hold fear in two modalities: pain, or power. Acting from pain
            means believing that you “can't handle it”, allowing yourself to
            become helpless and frozen; power is self-belief, acting
            <em>as if</em> you are totally capable of success and treating
            difficulties as growth opportunities. Jeffers suggests trying to
            take a risk every day: not only does this give you evidence that you
            can handle things well, it also requires you to make decisions and
            taking action rather than live life passively.
        </p>

            4. Whether You Want It or Not… It's Yours
        </h3>
        <p>
            She suggests we take <strong>complete</strong> responsibility for
            our own lives, not blaming others for our own actions and feelings.
            At the same time it is important to not blame ourselves: if I call
            myself “hopeless” and believe I can never succeed, then I'm
            abdicating responsibility to fate. She also stresses the importance
            of being aware of our choices, and making sure that we know when we
            are acting from pain or from power: self-awareness and gradual
            improvement beats out kicking yourself while you're down, every
            time.

        <h3 id="pollyanna-rides-again">5. Pollyanna Rides Again</h3>
        <p>
            Jeffers argues that optimism is no more or less realistic than
            pessimism — and since it makes us happier, why not be optimistic?
            However she stresses that we shouldn't ignore pain or suffering:
            these exist, in our own lives and in the world. Thinking positively
            means believing that we are capable of handling terrible
            circumstances and finding solutions.
        </p>
        <h3 id="when-they-dont-want-you-to-grow">
            6. When “They” Don't Want You to Grow
        </h3>
        <p>
            Jeffers argues that some people in our lives will sabotage our
            growth, possibly unconsciously, because they are used to and
            comfortable with us as we are. She suggests surrounding ourselves
            with people who support our growth, and communicating openly and
            clearly with our loved ones who don't support us. She brings up the
            “pasive-to-obnoxious-to-healthy” model: we may over- or
            under-correct while learning to be assertive, but this is a normal
            part of the learning process.
        </p>
        <h3 id="how-to-make-a-no-lose-decision">
            7. How to Make a No-Lose Decision
        </h3>
        <p>Two decision-making models are suggesting:</p>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>
                The no-win model, where one choice is right and the other is
                wrong but we cannot know in advance which is which
            </li>
            <li>
                The no-lose model: both choices are right, since they present
                “opportunities to experience life in a new way”
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            The idea is to remove the fear of “being wrong” and making the wrong
            decision, and instead focus on what kind of life we want to lead.
            Jeffers also suggests “throwing away your picture” after a decision
            is made: rather than obsessing over how a new job isn't how we
            imagined it would be, focus on how it <em>is</em> and what we can
            learn from the experience.
        </p>
        <h3 id="how-whole-is-your-whole-life">
            8. How Whole Is Your “Whole Life”?
        </h3>
        <p>
            The point is made that for many self-described “independent” people,
            their lives are focused on one thing:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>family</li>
            <li>career</li>
            <li>friendship</li>
            <li>leisure</li>
            <li>etc.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            If this one thing becomes untenable, due to the lose of a loved one
            or a chronic injury say, then our lives can become suddenly empty
            and challenging. Instead, we should aim to have a broad and varied
            life and commit ourselves fully to each part of it: essentially,
            give your life some redundancy.
        </p>
        <h3 id="just-nod-your-head-say-yes">
            9. Just Nod Your Head &mdash; Say “Yes!”
        </h3>
        <p>
            Jeffers asks us to “say yes to our universe”: accepting whatever
            life throws at us and working with it (compare the x-y chart in
            <a href="/books/non-fiction/happy/"><em>Happy</em></a
            >]). She quotes Viktor Frankl
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                [e]verything can be taken away from a man but one thing: the
                last of the human freedoms — to choose one's attitude in any
                given set of circumstances, to choose one's way.
            </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            She calls this freedom “saying yes”: accept the circumstances,
            choose your attitude, and do your best to create your own way in
            life.
        </p>
        <p>

                enough books I've read have referenced it.</small

        </p>
        <h3 id="choosing-love-and-trust">10. Choosing Love and Trust</h3>
        <p>
            Jeffers argues that genuine “giving” is when we expect nothing in
            return, and that many people who think of themselves as giving are
            actually more concerned with what they get out of the exchange. She
            believes that this is rooted in a fear of lack: it is difficult to
            give our time or money away when we believe we couldn't live without
            it. Another useful model that comes up in this chapter is acting
            <em>as if</em>:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                Ask yourself, "If I really counted? What would I be doing in
                this situation?["]
            </p>
        </blockquote>
        <h3 id="filling-the-inner-void">11. Filling the Inner Void</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>NB:</strong> I found this chapter less appealing due to my
            personal beliefs and spirituality and human interconnectedness.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here Jeffers connects action from power with communing with some
            Higher Self or Power. She doesn't require this to be a religious
            connection, but does advocate the full development of each part of
            the body-mind-spirit triad. She believes are answers can be found
            within by the subconscious mind, and that by acting in accordance
            with the Higher Self we end up on a path of abundance and
            experience.
        </p>
        <p><small> Compare Psalm 139 16 (ESV): </small></p>
        <blockquote>
            Your eyes saw my unformed substance;<br />
            in your book was written, every one of them,<br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the days that were formed for me,<br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when as yet there was none of them.
