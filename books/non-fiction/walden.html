<h1>Walden (Henry David Thoreau)</h1>

<h2>Chapter Summaries</h2>

<h3>1. Economy</h3>

<p>A person&rsquo;s unhappiness and discontent is a result of societal obligations to own possesions, and having to work to afford them. One should instead live more simply and focus on improving oneself rather than one&rsquo;s surroundings, as Thoreau attempts to demonstrate. There is a lot of unfortunate racial stuff in here.</p>

<h3>2. Where I Lived, And What I Lived For</h3>

<p>Thoreau begins with a description of his time at Walden Pond in late summer, how his house was built and how pleasant he found the place. Modern society is build on meaningless &ldquo;progress&rdquo; (e.g. the emptiness of the daily news), and often at the expense of many people (e.g. the railroad). Rather than rushing about from place to place on business, one might live mindfully and with clear purpose, allowing the world to go on as it does.</p>

<h3>3. Reading</h3>

<p>Reading fits well into this philosophy, being a slow, considered form of self-development and entertainment. Thoreau maents how people &lsquo;waste&rsquo; time on &ldquo;easy reading&rdquo;, contenting themselves with mass entertainment rather than grappling with the enduring classics. He argues for collective adult education and a system of focused self-betterment, what he calls the &ldquo;_un_common school&rdquo;.</p>

<h3>4. Sounds</h3>

<p>The book returns to summer, in particular the sounds of nature &mdash; birds and animals &mdash; contrasted with the insistence of the railroad. In particular Thoreau valorises the cockerel with its punctual, open nature. Meditation, meaning time spent observing the work as it is without working the body or mind, is both pleasant and worthwhile in itself.</p>
