      <description>The Luddites have been victims of a consistent mischaracterisation of their politics and historical importance. Rather than the technophobic reactionaries they&amp;rsquo;re often presented as, Breaking Things At Work argues that the Luddites identified technology as a political tool, and one that can be opposed. Gavin Mueller paints Luddism as an early form of organised labour, opposing proto-capitalism with direct action. Capitalist technology is used &amp;mdash; Mueller argues can only be used &amp;mdash; to further the interests of capital, namely: exploitation, control, extraction of value.</description>

      <description>Three Sentence Summary Luddism has been unfairly painted as technophobic; in reality it identified that technology is a political tool used to control and exploit labour, that can and should be resisted. The accelerationist left and pro-automation union leaders have been more concerned with how technology could help the worker of the future, than how it is making people&amp;rsquo;s lives worse now. The reality of automation in the workplace has always been one of fractioning, alienation and control, resisted repeatedly by workers through labour organising, machine-breaking and ingenious sabotage.</description>

      <description>Three Sentence Summary In Marx&amp;rsquo;s conception of industrial capitalism as
 Exploitative and alienating production of goods The realisation of value through trade and the resulting accumulation of capital  the sea is interesting as both a site of production (fishing) and a medium for circulation (shipping). Capitalists exploit both, choosing their own labour laws either through historical imperialism or modern flags of convenience, whilst continuing unsustainable fishing practices with the EEZ.</description>

      <description>Three Sentence Summary Our happiness is largely determined by the stories we tell ourselves after the fact, Daniel Kahneman&amp;rsquo;s remembering self. The Stoics offer two suggestions:
 It is my own judgement that is causing my suffering, and I have the power to change that judgement now Don&amp;rsquo;t try to change things that I cannot control  Tools to help with suffering are talking to myself, not adding to first impressions, premeditating the loss of things I hold dear, and asking myself, &amp;ldquo;Do I have a problem right now?</description>

      <title>Liberalism At Large</title>

      <description>Three Sentence Summary A detailed overview of historically dominant strains of liberalism, as embodied by the editors of the Economist. This liberalism is identified with:
 the preference for financial elites as political decision-makers, over open democracy a belief in empire (both British and later American) and the use of force to ensure free trade for imperial investors a laissez-faire approach to domestic finance wherever possible, leaving government to resolve crises as they developed  The Economist not only shaped and spread this policy, but as editors both came from and moved into powerful financial and political positions, it played a role in implementing it too.</description>

      <description>Note: I found this incredibly difficult to summarise, and I don&amp;rsquo;t know if I have the ability to articulate my thoughts &amp;mdash; but I&amp;rsquo;ll do my best.
Three Sentence Summary The book is a &amp;lsquo;critique of&amp;rsquo; critique of the spectacle, described as the belief that the bombardment of images and spectacles has rendered democractic subjects passive and ignorant. Ranci√®re sees this as a reaction to the breakdown of cause and effect in artistic intent, and relates it to the Victorian idea that the &amp;ldquo;fragile brains&amp;rdquo; of poor people were too easily influenced by and unable to comprehend consumer society.</description>

      <description>Three Sentence Summary Poirot and Hastings, along with an arrogant Parisian detective, investigate the murder of a rich man under seemingly familiar circumstances. The solution lies in recalling this infamous crime and unravelling the man&amp;rsquo;s son&amp;rsquo;s love life. An incredibly convoluted plot with a disappointing, confusing ending.</description>

      <description>Three Sentence Summary While visiting the home of some friends, Mr. Hastings not only witnesses a murder by poisoning but also runs into his friend, the acclaimed Belgian detective Poirot. Poirot and Hastings begin their investigation, with Hastings never quite seeing things as clearly as Poirot wishes. Offhand remarks which have aged rather poorly mar an otherwise very fun detective story.</description>

      <description>Three Sentence Summary Katherine Angel posits that consent is not enough, that while positive consent is the &amp;ldquo;least bad standard&amp;rdquo; for sexual assault legislation, it isn&amp;rsquo;t equipped to make &amp;ldquo;sex good again&amp;rdquo;. She is critical of confidence culture, the idea that a woman should be invulnerable and self-confident &amp;mdash; either knowing her desires and giving positive consent, or boldly rebuffing any man who crosses her boundaries. She argues instead for a model of sexual assault that places responsibility with the assaulter; for recognition of the power dynamics and inequality inherent in sex; and for acceptance of women&amp;rsquo;s (and men&amp;rsquo;s) sexual vulnerability, and the pleasure that can be found in experimentation and uncertainty.</description>
