  Fantastic follow-up, I think I maybe even preferred this to <i>Gideon</i>. The
  structure of this book &mdash; half second-person follow-on, half a bizarro
  retelling of <i>Gideon</i> &mdash; was immediately compelling, and Muir
  navigated it so well. I really want this series to stick the landing.
