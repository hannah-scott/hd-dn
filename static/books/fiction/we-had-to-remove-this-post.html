  A woman in a shitty financial position takes a job at a social media company:
  all day, every day, she moderates extreme content on the platform. But as the
  videos she and her colleagues have to look at become more violent, their
  relationships and their humanity become more twisted and broken. A really
  compellingly written, compassionately bleak story about the trauma we inflict
  on ourselves and each other.
