<h1 class="title">The Dispossessed</h1>
<p class="author">Ursula K. Le Guin</p>

<p>
  A society of revolutionary anarchists live on a moon orbiting the capitalist
  oppressors they fought against — over time, the community has begun to ossify,
  and unspoken hierarchies are forming.
</p>
<p>
  In the midst of this, an anarchist physicist whose ideas are rejected as
  trivial and counter-revolutionary chooses to return to the “home planet” —
  ostensibly to spread the word of his ground-breaking discoveries, but also to
  embody the spirit of permanent revolution and try to shake his fellow
  anarchists out of their complacency.
</p>
<p>
  Just an excellent book: compassionately explores the benefits and dangers of
  revolutionary anarchism, highlighting how hierarchies of unjust power develop
  and the injustices of life for the exploited — and exploiters — under
  capitalism.
