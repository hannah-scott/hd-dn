  Somewhere in a place between worlds there is a House: it is made up of a
  seemingly endless number of rooms, and a churning sea which provides all the
  food one needs to survive.
</p>
<p>
  Within the House there are two people — Piranesi (although that is not his
  name), and the Other — and seemingly no entrances or exits: how did these two
  come to be here?
</p>
<p>
  A neat little mystery, although not what I was expecting: I was anticipating
  something like Kitty Horrorshow's <em>ANATOMY</em>, an exploration of emotion
  through the interaction between inhabitor and architecture — the novel is more
  conventionally character-driven and I wished we'd spent more time exploring
  the House.
