  A collection of horror short stories set in and around Buenos Aires. Covers a
  range of horror genres: some of the stories instill this air of creeping
  dread, while others go all-out with disgusting and horrific imagery. Reminds
  me in terms of tone of Junji Ito's short collections â€” really excellent.
