  <p>A queer photographer is dragged back to her hometown to shoot
  the wedding of her estranged step-sister. But both she and the
  bridesmaid are immediately physically attracted to each other,
  and as they try to keep their newfound love a secret they
  struggle with another problem: the shit-head groom-to-be. A
  compassionate, sexy, kind-hearted story about the secrets we keep
  from each other and the pain and beauty of letting people into
  our lives.</p>
