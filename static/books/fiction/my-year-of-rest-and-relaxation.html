  A depressed rich woman takes herself out of the world following a
  meaningless/meaningful breakup, taking prescription drugs in an attempt to
  sleep for a year. As she wanders through Manhattan and upstate New York in a
  blur, she becomes more and more obsessed with her mission and more distant
  from those around her. I loved this: a well-captured image of depression, the
  desperation and the loneliness of it all.
