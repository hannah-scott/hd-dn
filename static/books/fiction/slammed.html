  A closeted tennis ace starts to fall out of love with her sport — and in love
  with a beautiful up-and-coming player. Her friends on the tour uncover proof
  of racist drug testing practices, and together they take a stand. A fresh and
  enjoyable lesbian romance: not racey enough that I would feel weird reading it
  on the beach, but definitely not sexless — perfect!
