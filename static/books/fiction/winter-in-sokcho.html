  A woman works as a receptionist in the South Korean border town of Sokcho
  during the off-season. When a comic book artist from France arrives, she
  develops feelings for him and tries to start a relationship â€” but he holds her
  and her country at arm's reach. Reads well and quickly, I really enjoyed it.
