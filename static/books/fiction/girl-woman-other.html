  Really beautiful. I loved the central conceit of connectedness and
  interconnectedness between these different people, this sense of Britain being
  very large and very small &mdash; and the world, too. People coming from
  across the world, having room enough to live entire lives but not enough to
  avoid bumping into each other. This sort of idea of community, whether it's
  actively searched out or completely unknown. Very moving book, I love this.
