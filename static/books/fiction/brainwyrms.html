  <p>Frankie, a trans woman whose workplace has been bombed by a
  TERF terrorist, is numbing her pain with kinky sex and drugs;
  Vanya, a non-binary teen runaway, satisfies their secret
  fucked-up urges while living in precarious housing. When they
  meet, the trajectories of both of their lives are changed
  irreversibly. The world is pure Rumfitt: fascism, transphobia and
  misogyny intersect and feed off each other in a vicious,
  parasitic cycle of internalised and externalised hate, festering
  and eating away at everything until only violent and
  self-destructive drives remain.</p>
  <p>This book is vile and impossible to recommend and I loved it:
  a maelstrom of ambitious ideas that I will never fully shake
  myself of.</p>
