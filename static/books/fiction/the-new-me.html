  A woman muddles through her life, her job, everything seeming pointless â€” she
  thinks she's above it all. As she interacts with the people around her, all
  finding value in <em>some</em> part of their lives, she becomes more and more
  lost in a world without meaning. An interesting character study, although it
  didn't really stick with me.
