  <p>Irina is a fetish photographer preparing for an upcoming
  exhibition on her subect of choice: boys. But as she works —
  scouting models off the streets, pushing artistic boundaries,
  luxuriating in her transgression — one boy's face keeps forcing
  itself back into her thoughts. A wonderful and sick novel,
  drawing threads between Sontag's violence of the image &amp; the
  omnipresent violence of systemic misogyny, wealth inequality,
  homophobia, racism and addiction.</p>
