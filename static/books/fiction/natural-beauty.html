  <p>Having abandoned her life of classical music following a
  tragic accident, our obliquely-name narrator begins working for a
  cutting-edge beauty company that sells experimental procedures to
  the obscenely wealthy. But what is happening in the tunnels
  underneath the stores — what is the purpose of their bizarre
  compound/farm out in the desert — and why has her body started
  changing so dramatically? I really enjoyed this book, but there
  are two fantastic novels in here and sometimes they get in each
  others' way.</p>
