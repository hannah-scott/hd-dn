  Pretty much every trigger warning on this one: I loved it, but it's really
  difficult to recommend to anyone.

  Three people enter a house — two leave — and the trauma clings to the
  survivors, tearing in at every moment of their lives until the only thing left
  to do is confront it, shaking and terrified. A horrifyingly visceral story of
  fascism and intergenerational trauma — the ways we hurt and hate ourselves and
  each other — how the powerless are made to fight by the powerful. I love a
  story about a <em>location</em> that's evil: reminded me of <em>ANATOMY</em>,
  which is the highest praise from me.
