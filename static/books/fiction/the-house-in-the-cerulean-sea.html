  In a world of orphanages for magical children, a well-meaning but beaten-down
  social worker is sent to a home on a mysterious island to assess its
  inhabitants' safety. But the children — and caretakers — he meets challenge
  all of his preconceived notion, and he begins to question how much good the
  system actually does. A book about overcoming bigotry, defining one's self,
  and chosen families.
