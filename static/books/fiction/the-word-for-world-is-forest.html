  In a future where all green life on Earth has been destroyed, the human army
  travel to an alien world of forests and enslaves its people to harvest lumber.
  The indigenous people, normally a peaceful society led by the visions of
  dreaming men and the direction of practical women, fight back viciously and
  overcome the soldiers &mdash; but knowing such violence, how can they return
  to their peaceful lives?

  A beautiful, brief and very difficult book: my copy begins with an essay by Le
  Guin on how the story became a "preachment" in light of her opposition to the
  Vietnam War, and asks if it's moral for an author to exert such influence over
  others and preach through their stories.
