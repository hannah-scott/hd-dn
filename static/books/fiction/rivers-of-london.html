  A newly-minted PC encounters a ghost while doing grunt work on a murder case,
  and soon becomes an apprentice in the magical wing of the Metropolitan Police.
  A series of pretty grisly incidents occur, which he realises are all part of a
  macabre real-world performance of a Punch and Judy show. A pretty fun and
  enjoyable supernatural police procedural that does some interesting stuff with
  the spirit and history of a cityâ€¦ but the main character is
  <em>far</em> too horny for me.
