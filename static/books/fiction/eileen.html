  <p>Eileen is a — say it with me now — depressed woman in her
  early 20s struggles to find meaning in her life: her mother is
  dead, her father an alcoholic, and she spends her days at her job
  in a boys' prison, lusting after an overzealous guard who doesn't
  even know her name. When a rich, elegant and over-qualified new
  educator arrives, Eileen falls hard for her and resolves that
  this relationship will be her way out of her dead-end town —
  whatever it takes. Moshfegh paints a compelling picture of
  Eileen, but there is just <em>barely</em> enough plot that I
  wanted more: <a href=
  "/books/fiction/my-year-of-rest-and-relaxation.html"><em>Rest and
  Relaxation</em></a> avoids this problem of course by having none,
  and being better for it.</p>
