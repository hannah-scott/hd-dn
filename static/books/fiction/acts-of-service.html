  <p>A queer woman in a seemingly stable, happy relationship begins
  a troubling affair with a powerful, rich, self-assured man and a
  painfully shy woman. At times this book did capture something
  truly interesting — but I found it lapsed too often into "the
  philosophical and feminist meaning of wanting a man to fuck you"
  for my tastes, and the latter half was more effective for Eve's
  growing into her comfortable discomfort. I found the sex scenes,
  particularly the earlier ones, evoked almost a body horror
  distaste and disgust in me, something I haven't experienced
  before with consensual sex in literature — and I wonder to what
  extent this feeling was intended by the author, to what extent my
  revulsion at the meaningless of male dominance being played out
  as erotic subversion.</p>
  <p>I did not hate this book.</p>
