  The story of court betrayal and guerilla warfare, holy revolution and the
  terror of one's own fate. While I liked the main cast, I found the support
  characters somewhat thin and the ending quite rushed. Compelling and wide in
  its scope and imagination, a nice blend of fantasy, history and
  science-fiction genre writing.
