  <p>Again, Muir has a character with no context or awareness of
  the world around them, struggling to understand what is happening
  â€” and again, she nails it. I understand that this book is
  controversial in the fandom, but I'm an out-and-out <em>Nona</em>
  fan. By shrinking the scope of her work and zooming in on a
  neighbourhood struggling under the Houses' fascist rule, Muir
  brings context, grace and humanity into an
  intergalactic-ten-thousand-year space opera while
  recontextualising thanergy, "death energy", as what it really is:
  extractive murder that consolidates power for the powerful.</p>
