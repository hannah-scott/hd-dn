  <p>A weird, witchy woman spends her winters in an isolated
  village in Poland: her days are spent drawing up horoscopes,
  tending to the homes of the rich out-of-towners, and loudly
  protesting the police to stop hunters and poachers. But then her
  neighbour, a well-known poacher, turns up dead — and all signs
  point to the impossible: the Animals are taking revenge.
  Powerfully written, asks hard questions about how and why we
  should extend compassion and justice to those society sees as
  less-human — whether that is animals, the mentally ill, the poor
  — whomever.</p>
