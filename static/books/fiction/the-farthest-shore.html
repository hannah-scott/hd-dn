  A young prince, heir to a long-empty throne, comes to the island of mages with
  word that magic is failing. He and the archmage set out across the sea to
  investigate, finding at the edges of the world the fatal consequences of
  mages' misled desires to cheat death. They journey into and through the land
  of the dead to defeat the man responsible, restoring hope and wisdom to the
  world.
