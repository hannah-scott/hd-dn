<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>
  The book is partly an overview of Waitzkin's successful careers as a
  high-level chess player and martial artist, partly a philosophical treatise on
  the nature of learning.
</p>
<p>
  One theme he comes back to a lot is shared patterns and commonalities between
  different disciplines, which rang true to me â€” as did his insistence that
  mastery is a very advanced application of the basics.
</p>
<p>
  His ideas around time dilation were less compelling, and while I found the
  practical advice interesting and might apply some of it in my own learning
  there just wasn't enough of it for me.
