  This book is a study of translations of the New Testament through the lens of
  theological bias. The author examines a number of different translations to
  find common areas where translational rigour is traded off to make a specific
  point that furthers someone's beliefs. I adored this — the author goes to
  lengths to stress that bias is not necessarily malicious or deliberate, while
  managing an approachable and funny tone — this book has changed how I read the
  New Testament.
