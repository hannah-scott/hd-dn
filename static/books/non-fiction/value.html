  Bayley argues that aesthetic enjoyment of physical objects and pastimes is
  being neglected in favour or a more detached engagement with digital tech — in
  a series of loosely connected short essays, he lays out a rough sketch of what
  a “hedonistic” life might contain:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>time spent in nature and around good art</li>
  <li>mindful enjoyment simple pleasures</li>
  <li>money spent well on pieces that last</li>
</ul>
<p>
  He seems somewhat uninterested in physical pleasure and sex as a physical act,
  often favouring intellectual engagement over simple “pleasure”, which grates
  against my own stance. I also found his tone somewhat pretentious and
  self-important, and while a lot of the book was entertaining by the end I was
  growing a bit tired of him.
