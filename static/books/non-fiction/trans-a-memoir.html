<h1 class="title">Trans</h1>
<p class="author">Juliet Jacques</p>

  Juliet writes the story of her transition in two parts &mdash; the personal
  and the political, which she emphasises are the same. Breaking up her
  day-to-day social interactions, living paycheck to paycheck while coming to
  terms with her identity, are essays of theory and how she sees the meaning of
  "transness" to extend far beyond the typical narrative that focuses solely on
  a change in appearance and body. Trans identities are often politicised
  without our consent: radically accepting that politicisation, and using it to
  serve our wider goals, certainly seems a viable option.
