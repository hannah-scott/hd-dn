<h1 class="title">Toki Pona: The Language Of Good</h1>
<p class="author">Sonja Lang</p>

<p>
  Sonja Lang introduces a microlanguage structured around minimalism and mindful
  awareness of the present. As an educational text, the quality of exercises is
  really high and the ideas are expressed clearly. This book didn't take a long
  time to work through, and I really enjoyed doing it.
