  Really good book. Makes a strong case for UBI in its last chapter but that's
  not the point. Rather than being a pro-UBI book, this is a decidedly
  anti-shitty job and therefore pro-human being one. I don't even want to say
  it's an argument in favour of the worker: he makes an argument that a person's
  ability to do something for fun or its own sake is inherently good and that
  people (if they so choose) should just broadly be allowed to fuck about. We
  are pro-fucking about here at Hannah's Big Book Emporium.
