            Really good book. Makes a strong case for UBI in its last chapter
            but that's not the point. Rather than being a pro-UBI book, this is
            a decidedly anti-shitty job and therefore pro-human being one. I
            don't even want to say it's an argument in favour of the worker: he
            makes an argument that a person's ability to do something for fun or
            its own sake is inherently good and that people (if they so choose)
            should just broadly be allowed to fuck about. We are pro-fucking
            about here at Hannah's Big Book Emporium.
