    <p>
      The decline of religion in modern times has left a spiritual gap in many
      people's lives, which some have filled through diverse communities and
      practices. The author asks us to consider introducing aspects into our own
      lives, such as
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Sacred reading</li>
      <li>Making pilgrimage</li>
      <li>Living with the seasons</li>
      <li>A prayer practice</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Finally, he stresses that our own personal religions and rituals can be as
      fulfilling, or even more so, than traditional ones: the important thing is
      to intentionally practice ritual and engage with the world around us in a
      way that feels authentic and real.
    </p>

    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Although more of us are identifying as non-religious, the spiritual ritual
      needs that religion meets are still an integral and often overlooked part
      of being people. The author found during research that people met these
      needs through Cross Fit, social groups, secular meditation, cooking: so
      many diverse and seemingly non-spiritual activities became vital
      nourishing wellsprings. He suggests it is not so much to activity itself,
      but the intentional ritual of practicing it, that gives it this
      transformative nature and that we can use in our own lives.
    </p>
    <h2 id="connecting-with-self">1. Connecting with Self</h2>
    <p>
      Many of us have become disconnected from ourselves, unable or unwilling to
      recognise our feelings and spend time with our own thoughts. The practice
      of sacred reading can offer a mirror to ourselves — reading a text
      <em>as if</em> it held spiritual meaning, and asking
    </p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>What is literally happening in the narrative?</li>
      <li>What allegorical stories and images occur to you?</li>
      <li>What experiences in your own life does this make you think of?</li>
      <li>What action are you being asked to take?</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The author also suggests creating a Sabbath, time in the week that you
      treat as sacred, and himself observes a “tech sabbath” for 24 hours each
      week.
    </p>
    <h2 id="connecting-with-others">2. Connecting with Others</h2>
    <p>
      In his research the author noticed a cluster of spiritual groups built
      around two things: eating together, and exercising together. He suggests
      ritualised group meals, and gives examples of groups who come together to
      share food and engage with each other on quite deep levels. Exercise can
      also be deeply spiritual, with shared sweat and motion heightening our
      connections with others as we all work towards a common objective.
    </p>
    <h2 id="connecting-with-nature">3. Connecting with Nature</h2>
    <p>
      Modern society has become particularly disconnected from nature, often
      viewing it as an adversarial force to be dominated or commodified. Making
      pilgrimage on foot to some certain location, observing the world around
      you as you move, can be a way to reconnect with it: the author advocates
      circling your pilgrimage site and drinking in every source of sensory
      information. At the same time we can reconnect with the seasons by eating
      seasonally, or following a “liturgical calendar” of our own design and
      ritual.
    </p>
    <h2 id="connecting-with-transcendence">4. Connecting with Transcendence</h2>
    <p>
      The author suggests prayer as a way to connect with the transcendent, and
      gives the broad definition of that ephemeral thing which is “greater than
      the self”: a higher power. He follows the traditional model of ACTS
      prayer:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Adoration</li>
      <li>Contrition</li>
      <li>Thanksgiving</li>
      <li>Supplication</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Finally, he notes that prayer is often deeply personal and can take as
      many forms as we please: putting on makeup, cooking, walking the dog can
      all be a prayer that celebrates and helps us stay connected to higher
      calling.
    </p>
    <h2 id="already-connected">5. Already Connected</h2>
    <p>
      Throughout the book the author has stressed that ritual can be as flexible
      and individual, religious and secular as we want it to be. The important
      thing is not the act itself, but rather the intention to connect with the
      real and the self
      <em>through</em> the act. He reminds us that the word “ritual” implies a
      practice, and that the greatest and deepest benefits come from simple
      actions, repeated intentionally and often.
