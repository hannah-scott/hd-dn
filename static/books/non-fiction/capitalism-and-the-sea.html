    <h1 class="title">Capitalism And The Sea</h1>
    <p class="author">Liam Campling &amp; Alejandro Colás</p>

    <p>In Marx's conception of industrial capitalism as</p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>Exploitative and alienating production of goods</li>
      <li>
        The realisation of value through trade and the resulting accumulation of
        capital
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      the sea is both a site of production (fishing) and a medium for
      circulation (shipping). Capitalists exploit both, choosing their own
      labour laws either through historical imperialism or modern flags of
      convenience, whilst continuing unsustainable fishing practices with the
      EEZ. Capitalism has been shaped by the sea (e.g. weather as a barrier to
      trade), whilst also shaping it (e.g. land reclamation or ocean
      acidification): this is a terraqueous relationship, the result of applying
      land-based property rights onto the sea.
    </p>

    <p>
      The history of capitalism is intertwined with the geo-history of the sea,
      forming a terraqueous (land-and-sea) relationship. The sea has been a
      medium for shipping and oppression, resource extraction and waste
      disposal. The physical features of it have been as moulded by capital as
      capital has been shaped by those same features.
    </p>
    <h2 id="circulation">1. Circulation</h2>
    <p>
      The development of Marx's “real” industrial capitalism is a result of:
    </p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>Class conflict, exploitative and alienating production</li>
      <li>
        Circulation of produced goods, realisation of value, and capital
        accumulation
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The role of the sea in early commercial capitalism was to speed up
      circulation and value realisation through shipping. In England and
      Amsterdam, profits were reinvested and a network of industries and
      financial services were created to feed this trade.
    </p>
    <h2 id="order">2. Order</h2>
    <p>
      The history of imposing order on the sea can be divided into three
      distinct eras:
    </p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        The first notion of “freedom of the sea”, coexisting with piracy and
        privateering
      </li>
      <li>
        Global 'new navalism' and the sea as a battleground between emerging
        capitalist nations
      </li>
      <li>
        Enclosure through international treaties against the backdrop of the
        Cold War
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      From its inception, “freedom of the sea” has been used to justify
      profiteering and capitalist exploitation in disputed waters. The current
      US position of control through international convention has been an
      effective neo-colonial tool, but is ineffective in combatting piracy or
      the weaponisation of the EEZ in the South China Sea.
    </p>
    <h2 id="exploitation">3. Exploitation</h2>
    <p>
      Exploitation — extracting surplus value from labourers — is uniquely
      predatory and pervasive at sea. Shipowners:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        use <em>flags of convenience</em> to get around labour laws and high
        taxes
      </li>
      <li>
        suppress costs through <em>labour arbitrage</em>, hiring cheap labour
        from countries with lower wages
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Maritime labour plays a key role in the history of labour organisation,
      but have have a history of racist “white unionism” and nationalist
      ignorance to working conditions of foreign labourers.
    </p>
    <h2 id="appropriation">4. Appropriation</h2>
    <p>
      Fishing is an interesting study in the terraqueous nature of capital,
      since how an animal is fished is contingent on its biology (e.g. deep-sea
      fishing of highly migratory fish). At the same time, capitalists have
      extended land-based ideas of property rights to the sea using the idea of
      the EEZ. Historically and today, the discovery of new fishing regions from
      which private capital profits has been funded by public exploratory
      expeditions.
    </p>
    <h2 id="logistics">5. Logistics</h2>
    <p>
      Logistics in shipping is mainly concerned with the ability to
      <em>plan ahead</em>, to know what will be where, when. The early dominance
      of coal over wind is an example of accepting greater costs in exchange for
      reliability. The just-in-time nature (a feature of planning and profit
      chasing) makes the system more vulnerable to labour action, making control
      an integral part of modern shipping.
    </p>
    <h2 id="offshore">6. Offshore</h2>
    <p>
      Through its “remoteness, immensity, seclusion and fluidity,” the sea has
      become a place for capital to offshore elements and secure the dominant
      social order. Some of examples of this:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>tax havens and secrecy jurisdictions</li>
      <li>seasteading and islands for the ultra-rich</li>
      <li>more negatively, prison islands</li>
      <li>dumping waste</li>
      <li>nuclear weapons testing</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      A counterexample is global and oceanic warming, which cannot be offshored
      due to its global nature and which represents a terraqueous threat to
      human life.
    </p>
    <h2 id="terraqueous-horizons">7. Terraqueous Horizons</h2>
    <p>
      Seafaring is not inherently progressive, but contains potential for the
      realisation of an international anticapitalist cosmopolitanism. In order
      to achieve this, labour organisations would have to set aside their
      dominating attitudes (racism) and exploit the fragility of modern
      logistics networks. The terraqueous conception of freedom and stability,
      innovation and regulation, is thus a model for how our anticapitalist
      future could be built: the sea moulds us as we mould it.
