  Interesting left history of the BBC. Makes its points very strongly at times,
  at others seems like a list of quotations. Admittedly these quotations are in
  themselves damning.

  The structure is strong: beginning with fundamental institutional imbalances
  (foundational anti-communism, hiring being in bed with MI5) but around the
  middle the tone shifts to less of a “BBC willingly in bed with the state” and
  more of a “BBC acquiescing to the demands of the state” vibe. I suppose the
  point is that the heads have always been on the side of the establishment,
  whereas the rank and file journalists and engineers and such are just doing
  jobs and having establishment agendas forced upon them.

<p>Bonus points for referring to it as the Falklands/Malvinas war.</p>
