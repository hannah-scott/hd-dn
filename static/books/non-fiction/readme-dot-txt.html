<p class="author">Chelsea Manning</p>

<p>
  An account of Chelsea Manning's life up until she was freed from prison:
  through an abusive childhood and a period of homelessness; struggling with
  oppressive bureaucracy, secrecy and gender dysphoria in the military; and her
  leak, imprisonment and transition within the military prison system.
  Heartbreaking in parts, but I loved that she took the time to highlight the
  moments of beauty and solidarity that people create in the face of state
  violence and torture. As both a trans woman and a left libertarian, Chelsea
  has been a hero to me &mdash; I loved this book.
