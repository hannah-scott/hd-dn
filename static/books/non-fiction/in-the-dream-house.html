  A beautifully painful, bleak memoir about abuse &mdash; how queer abuse forms,
  the patterns of pain we follow, and the feeling that it was all somehow
  inevitable, prefigured. The choose-your-own-adventure section stands out
  &mdash; impossible places of peace, found only by breaking the rules; the
  paranoia of being found out. I love Machado's style so very much &mdash; I
  fear I'm not doing this book justice.
