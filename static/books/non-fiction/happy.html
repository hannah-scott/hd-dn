  I read this before I started doing chapter summaries, but I got a lot from
  this book and it is well worth the time.

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>
  Our happiness is largely determined by the stories we tell ourselves after the
  fact, Daniel Kahneman's
  <em>remembering self</em>. The Stoics offer two suggestions:
</p>
<ol type="1">
  <li>
    It is my own judgement that is causing my suffering, and I have the power to
    change that judgement now
  </li>
  <li>Don't try to change things that I cannot control</li>
</ol>
<p>
  Tools to help with suffering are talking to myself, not adding to first
  impressions, premeditating the loss of things I hold dear, and asking myself,
  “Do I have a problem
  <em>right now</em>?”
