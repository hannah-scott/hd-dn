  <h2 id="what-is-this">What is this?</h2>
  <p>I was inspired by <a href=
  "https://tilde.town/~dozens/sofa/">SOFA Club</a> to make a list
  of shit I've started. This will hold</p>
  <ul>
    <li>what I started</li>
    <li>when I started it</li>
    <li>a link if anything comes out of it</li>
    <li>and nothing else</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Hopefully it'll all roughly be in chronological order.</p>
  <p>Some things might have a published work come out of them —
  some might not! That's fine! The point is: <strong>start often,
  fuck achievements!</strong></p>
