<h1 class="title">Quotes</h1>

<p>
  I've collected quotes that speak to me for a while now. They can presage
  important things in my life &mdash; as I realised I was trans, I noticed many
  of the quotes I'd collected were about some sort of transition:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    And the day came when the risk to remain tight in a bud was more painful
    than the risk it took to blossom.<br />
    &ndash;

  The beauty of writing is in reading, finding a phrase that feels true and
  valuable to you. Well-written words can serve as guidestones, leading you
  towards the life you want &mdash; sometimes it can be a life you didn't even
  know you wanted. These quotes are a map. I hope they take me somewhere
  wonderful.
</p>

  I hope you find something that excites you here. If you have your own list of
  quotes, send it to me at
  <a href="mailto:hannah@hd-dn.com">hannah@hd-dn.com</a> &mdash; I'd love to
  read it.

<!-- <h2>A Note on Sources</h2>

        <p>
            Sourcing quotes online is a <em>nightmare</em>. Try searching most
            quotes and what you'll find is a series of SEO-optimised sites that
            aggregate quotes without any sourcing at all (Anaïs Nin is a
            particular victim of this). Wikiquotes is pretty good, but quite
            limited in its subjects. For that reason I've tried to find the
            original author or link a source &mdash; if I've got anything wrong
            please let me know.

    Life is a process of becoming, a combination of states we have to go
    through. Where people fail is that they wish to elect a state and remain in
    it. This is a kind of death.<br />

    Your eyes saw my unformed substance; in your book were written, every one of

<blockquote>
  <p>
    I had been looking for a name that did not represent who I was, but instead
    who I would like to become. I wanted something that would serve as a
    reminder to put curiousity above power, that did not lock myself in the
    past, but would force me forward toward that ideal.<br />

<blockquote>
  <p>
    In our bare feet we notice that the floor is dirty, and then we can sweep
    the floor or not, but either way it will be a new situation tomorrow. We
    can't treat this as a problem; there is not a solution to it. But a clean
    floor is nice to walk on anyway, and someday we may even be able to sweep
    the floor because we respect the dignity of our feet and not because we are
    afraid of the dirt.<br />

    Comfort cannot be combined with simplicity. And when life is no longer

<blockquote>
  <p>
    For we each of us deserve everything, every luxury that was ever piled in
    the tombs of the dead kings, and we each of us deserve nothing, not a
    mouthful of bread in hunger. Have we not eaten while another starved? Will
    you punish us for that? Will you reward us for the virtue of starving while
    others ate? No man earns punishment, no man earns reward. Free your mind of
    the idea of deserving, the idea of earning, and you will begin to be able to
    think.<br />

  <p>
    The time to worry is three months before a flight. Decide then whether or
    not the goal is worth the risks involved. If it is, stop worrying. To worry
    is to add another hazard.<br />
    &ndash; Amelia Earhart

<blockquote>
  <p>
    Revolutionary action is not a form of self-sacrifice, a grim dedication to
    doing whatever it takes to achieve a future world of freedom. It is the
    defiant insistence on acting as if one is already free. <br />

    All models are wrong, but some are useful.<br />

<blockquote>
  <p>
    The secret is to really begin. The present social organisation is not just
    delaying, it is also preventing and corrupting any practice of freedom. The
    only way to learn what freedom is, is to experiment with it, and to do so
    you must have the necessary time and space.<br />

  <p>
    Things don't have purposes, as if the universe were a machine, where every
    part has a useful function. What's the function of a galaxy? I don't know if
    our life has a purpose and I don't see that it matters. What does matter is
    that we're a part. Like a thread in a cloth or a grass-blade in a field. It
    is and we are. What we do is like wind blowing on the grass.<br />
