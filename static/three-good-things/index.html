  <h1 id="three-good-things">Three Good Things</h1>
  <p>Since July 2022 I've tried to make a habit of noting three
  good things that have happened throughout the day. This has done
  good for my mental health, and serves as a nice little diary of
  my life too!</p>This page is formatted as an <a href=
  "https://journal.miso.town/">HTML journal</a>, a cool format
  designed for syndication and micro-blogging. You can subscribe to
  my three good things with an RSS reader — the feed is available

    <ol type="1">
      <li>I got out of the city and went for a walk in the forest
      with a couple of women from church. It was such a beautiful
      day, loads of beech and oak trees. I was also very happy I'd
      downloaded Organic Maps before going, because we did end up
      getting a litle lost and it came in so handy having the
      trails mapped out 🌳</li>
      <li>I listened to <em>Punisher</em> by Phoebe Bridgers. I've
      never really taken the time to listen to Phoebe's music,
      despite loving boygenius, but it's really growing on me this
      time round 🎧</li>

          a big pasta dish for dinner with pesto, tofu, green beans
          and olives: it was so good! 🍝

      <li>I ate pie for breakfast, drank coffee and watched some of

      <li>My friend, girlfriend and partner all went to the cinema,
      we say <em>Fresh Kill</em> which was a fantastic slice of
      lesbian '90s cyberpunkiness 👩‍💻</li>
      <li>I had some fun in a bookshop with my partner, and started

      <li>My partner and I went to look at a flat this morning — it
      wasn't really for us, but it was lovely to be taking steps
      towards where we need to be, and I think we both now have
      more of an idea of what we <em>do</em> want from a house
      🏠</li>
      <li>We went and got breakfast from a lovely cafe nearby: I
      had a bagel and they got some french toast, and we drank some
      coffee and listened to the bangers they had going on the
      radio ☕</li>
      <li>My partner is on a date so I've written up a couple of
      book reviews, done some maintenance on the site, and now my
      plan is just to chill out. I've had a busy couple of weeks,
      it's kind of refreshing not to have anything to do other than
      relax 😪</li>

    <p>I updated all my old notes with links and emojis, as well as
    adding content warnings to some posts that contain potentially

    <p>Today I wrote an extra function for <a href=
    "https://github.com/hannah-scott/lark">lark</a> to handle
    conversion to markdown, and then used that to move all of this
    over to markdown. So moving forward this is going to be
    markdown — I'm using Obsidian to write all of this stuff so it
    makes more sense, IMO.</p>

      <li>I had an ADHD medication appointment which turned out
      just to be the pre-appointment — that wasn't communicated to
      me. A little frustrating, but it's a step towards where I
      want to be 💊</li>

          number of reasons — not least of which I've slept poorly.

    like logseq, in practice the mobile app wasn't super usable.

      <li>Reading some Borges, who I've discovered is a silly
      weirdo who writes funny stories. Why did no-one tell me this?
      This often happens with authors I perceive as "hard" —
      <em>Moby Dick</em> was the same, just a fun book about a
