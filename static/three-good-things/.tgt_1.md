## 2023-12-09

I pushed myself too hard over the past few weeks and am now really ill, which sucks for a number of reasons. I had to miss my girlfriend's gig, which I feel terrible about. Also had to skip a friend's 30th after they'd done me such a big favour last month.

But the purpose of these TGT posts is to notice positives, even and especially on bad days, so — here goes:

1. My partner and I went to a great breakfast spot by our new flat, then walked round the corner and stood outside our new place daydreaming about decorating it 🏡
2. [Örllewin]() shared an Android text editor he made a while ago, which really neatly fixes a problem I had in my phone workflow 📱
3. My partner and I watched _The Dawn Wall_, which was just beautifully fascinating. These films about the very limits of human physical potential are always so interesting — seeing someone plan, train for, achieve something that looks plainly impossible — inspiring 📽️

## 2023-12-08

1. I went climbing today, which was chill. They were resetting most of the gym so I worked on a few problems I hadn't tried before: a crimpy vertical V3 that I managed the first couple moves of, and a steep juggy V2 that I got to the final move of before my arms gave out 🧗‍♀️
2. Partner and I went to a wreath making workshop at my church 🎄
3. Started working on a little music player in LÖVE, for a sort of delayed December Adventure. I might post about that at some point, we'll see 🎧

## 2023-12-07

1. My work Christmas party was today, loads of fun 🍻
2. Manager and I went out for dinner at Wagamama and caught up. It was a nice chill dinner: with working from home, I don't speak to her much just about our personal lives so it was a really lovely way to get to know her better 🍜
3. We've exchanged on the flat! 🏡

Let's go! I'm so happy we've exchanged. This has been stressing me out for the past couple of months, and affecting my mental health. I've definitely been burying myself in work as a distraction, my immune system's been crashing, my diet's been crappy. Everything.

Now this is actually done, it's actually happening, it feels like a huge weight has been lifted from my shoulders. From here on out it's just moving money about. I can do that.

## 2023-12-06

1. Went to my girlfriend's place for dinner, always delicious 🥘
2. We continued our slow watch of _The Bear_ season 2, and also watched _Yes, God, Yes_ 📽️
3. I played with some kittens 🐈‍⬛

## 2023-12-05

1. My friend came round and we hung out together and caught up 🙂
2. We watched a terrible film, _Christmas on the Ranch_: just abysmal, but funny 📽️
3. I cooked some nice pasta 🍝

## 2023-12-04

1. Had my final physio session today and got signed off as broadly recovered. Hopefully I can start running again in the new year 💪
2. My third ADHD psychoeducation session was today. It was okay, not sure how beneficial they are really but — it feels nice to focus on myself for some time, and one of the videos on motivation was helpful 🙂
3. I went bouldering today. For the last couple of sessions I've been working on a roof problem that is allegedly V1: I managed to do one more move than last time! 🧗‍♀️

## 2023-12-03

## 2023-12-01

1. Had my first advent calendar chocolate — and it snowed?! Christmas is here folks 🎄
2. I got a date for buying a flat, very fucking exciting news 🏡
3. My partner was out, which means it's sicko film club. I watched _Haute Tension_ — definitely disappointing, there's so much potential in that narrative that it doesn't use. But taken as a straight exploitation flick it was pretty good, and always satisfying to tick off a landmark film like that 📽️

## 2023-11-30

1. My presentation at work went really well 👩‍💻
2. I've been watching a lot of _Revolutionary Girl Utena_ recently, such an interesting and surreal show 📺
3. Girlfriend and I went to see _Black Narcissus_ in cinemas, as part of BFI's Powell and Pressburger season. I believe it's my first P&P, and a really quite horny one to start on! 📽️

## 2023-11-29

1. I went climbing at lunch — sent a neat ungraded slab problem, and managed a couple of moves on a roof problem 🧗‍♀️

2. My friend who is visiting London came round, so I made us mapo tofu and we ate and caught up 🥘
3. We went to see _Bottoms_ with my partner — we missed the first 5-10 minutes, which possibly had some context for a few of the jokes that didn't land. But overall, hilarious. I saw it described in a Letterboxd review as the return of farce, which: 100% 📽

## 2023-11-27

1. My partner and I bought a Christmas tree 🎄
2. I played a bunch of bass, which was really fun! 🎸
3. My friend and I went to see _May December_ — possibly my favourite film released this year. Horny in a deeply uncomfortable way, laugh-out-loud funny, and Charles Merton giving just the most compassionate and nuanced performance. Cinema, baby! 📽

## 2023-11-26

1. I watched _Salò_, which was superb — and also my 100th film this year, which was a nice little lineup. I am going to have to watch it again soon. A lot going on 📽
	- Update: I forgot to log _Cocaine Bear_ back in March, meaning that it was actually my 101st film! Still a banger. Watch _Salò_.
2. My friend from church gave me his old bass, so I started learning how to play that 🎸
3. I finished _Boy Parts_: excellent book, highly recommend it 📚

## 2023-11-25

I watched three films today, so —

1. I had a very chill morning and watched _Promising Young Woman_, which was promising (ironically) but kinda toothless 🔪
2. My friend and girlfriend came round and we hung out all afternoon watching _Talk To Me_ 🤝
3. Partner got home, we ordered Chinese food and watched _Death on the Nile_ which was fuckin' abysmal ⛵

2. I read some more of _Boy Parts_, beautifully upsetting book 📚
3. Got Jellyfin running on my Raspberry Pi, love a home streaming setup 📽

## 2023-11-22

1. Girlfriend and I had dinner together 🥘

## 2023-11-21

1. Had dinner with my friend, good pizza 🍕
2. Went to see a talk between Eliza Clark, whose books I haven't read, and Alison Rumfitt, who has become one of my favourite authors! Both really interesting and funny speakers 📚
3. I tried out Audacious based on some recommendations for a Linux music player — loving it! 🎧

<summary>cw: Gaza conflict</summary>

3. Went to a left-leaning indie bookshop nearby and bought a copy of _How Europe Underdeveloped Africa_, as well as hearing about a couple of reading groups I might get involved in.

3. I fixed whatever was wrong with my bootloader and got my laptop back up and running — don't die on me yet baby! So I was able to ssh into the machine that hosts this website and update some stuff: certs, three good things, &c. 💻

### _Celeste_ Corner

I'm sitting on a 42:XX right now, which is great. Absolutely crushing. Good practice on Ridge today, but I'm very variable in all the chapters to be honest. I'll go from a 5:30 Temple to like, a 7:30 Temple in a single session. This is just consistency — just practice. I'll get there 🙂

## 2023-09-21

1. I had a follow-up call with my mortgage advisor — and have been approved! 🏠
2. My girlfriend and I went out for dinner together. It was pouring it down, and the front of the restaurant ended up flooding — we had to cross the water over a makeshift bridge of wooden pallets. The food was so delicious — smoky, rich, exactly what I needed 🔥
3. We had a polycule-&-friends cinema trip to see _Alucarda_, a queer nunsploitation film. It was hilarious, sexy and weird — perfect! 📽

### _Celeste_ Corner

Did some practice runs today focusing on Temple, and got a 47:XX which isn't bad. There's a lot of variability in my times, particularly Ridge, Temple and Summit — I think that's where I need to focus work.

## 2023-09-20

2. I got takeout for us from a local community kitchen, and the food was _so goddamn good_ 🥘
3. Started learning French in earnest, with a bit more seriousness than in the past. I got a copy of _Colloquial French_ to work through 🇫🇷

## 2023-09-06

1. Ate some really good sushi for dinner 🍣
2. Today was the first session of the new book at my church's book club. We're reading _Attached to God_ 📖
3. Partner and I watched an absolutely appalling Hallmark movie, _Sweet Autumn_ — I love watching trash with them 📽️

## 2023-09-05

1. My partner was ill today — bad — so we hung out on the sofa working and watching _Scooby Doo_ cartoons 📺
2. I went to the park with my girlfriend and her friends and enjoyed the evening sun 🌞
3. Girlfriend and I hung out and got dinner together, and watched more of _Dead Ringers_ and _The Bear_ 💜

## 2023-09-04

1. I went for a really lovely run 🏃‍♀️
2. I watched _Fifty Shades of Grey_ which — to my shame — I really had fun with 📽️
3. I cooked pasta with pesto and peas 🍝

## 2023-09-03

A day spent relaxing.

1. I finished [_Acts of Service_](/books/fiction/acts-of-service.html), which was not terrible — although it wasn't _great_ either — and began _The Society of the Spectacle_ which I'm loving so far 📚
2. My partner and I played _Stardew Valley_ together 🎮
3. I spoke over text with my close friend about what we've been reading, doing, thinking — it's always a joy to talk to her 🙂

## 2023-09-02

Reader, I am once again unwell.

1. My partner had a very early start today which meant I was awake around 6:15 this morning. So I watched the first episodes of a few animes — I enjoyed the _Rurouni Kenshin_ remake a fair amount, and loved both _Chainsaw Man_ and _Salaryman's Club_ 📺
2. I played a bunch of _OlliOlli World_, which can best be described as a "build-a-queer" simulator: every player character has an undeniably trans quality 🎮
3. I finished [_Eileen_](/books/fiction/eileen.html), which I actually quite enjoyed — although not as much as [_Rest and Relaxation_](/books/fiction/my-year-of-rest-and-relaxation.html) — and have started _Acts of Service_ 📚

## 2023-09-01

1. It was my partner's day off today, so we got to spend time together in the house and I got to make us both lunch 🥘
2. I ran our second D&D session, which went well and was really fun 🎲
3. My partner and I got takeout vegan chicken for dinner, delicious 🥬

## 2023-08-31

1. I set up my [digital garden](https://garden.hd-dn.com) and got [FreshRSS](https://rss.hd-dn.com) running again — a good day for small parts of HD-DN 🌳
2. I went to see _Scrapper_ with my girlfriend, which was excellent: highly recommend it 📽
3. I looked through some of my old bookmarks and ended up doing some puzzles on [_Daily Deductions_](https://dailydeductions.com/), nice little way to pass time 🙂

1. I played some _Blasphemous_ yesterday, it's a good midpoint between challenging and **too** challenging for me 🎮
2. Had a really fun date with someone, we hung out in the park and had dinner together. It was super cute — and we also had productive chats about what we want and need from relationships, which is always good to do 🌳
3. I got home from my date and did the first day of a 30-day yoga course online. I don't know if I'll finish this ([SOFA](/sofa.html)) but we'll see 🙂

1. I got out of the city and went for a walk in the forest with a couple of women from church. It was such a beautiful day, loads of beech and oak trees. I was also very happy I'd downloaded Organic Maps before going, because we did end up getting a litle lost and it came in so handy having the trails mapped out 🌳
2. I listened to _Punisher_ by Phoebe Bridgers. I've never really taken the time to listen to Phoebe's music, despite loving boygenius, but it's really growing on me this time round 🎧

1. I ate pie for breakfast, drank coffee and watched some of an hbomberguy video 🍏
2. My friend, girlfriend and partner all went to the cinema, we saw _Fresh Kill_ which was a fantastic slice of lesbian '90s cyberpunkiness 👩‍💻
3. I had some fun in a bookshop with my partner, and started reading _Eileen_ by Ottessa Moshfegh 📖

## 2023-08-26

1. My partner and I went to look at a flat this morning — it wasn't really for us, but it was lovely to be taking steps towards where we need to be, and I think we both now have more of an idea of what we _do_ want from a house 🏠
2. We went and got breakfast from a lovely cafe nearby: I had a bagel and they got some french toast, and we drank some coffee and listened to the bangers they had going on the radio ☕
3. My partner is on a date so I've written up a couple of book reviews, done some maintenance on the site, and now my plan is just to chill out. I've had a busy couple of weeks, it's kind of refreshing not to have anything to do other than relax 😪

I updated all my old notes with links and emojis, as well as adding content warnings to some posts that contain potentially triggering shit. They look like this:

Today I wrote an extra function for [lark](https://github.com/hannah-scott/lark) to handle conversion to markdown, and then used that to move all of this over to markdown. So moving forward this is going to be markdown — I'm using Obsidian to write all of this stuff so it makes more sense, IMO.

I also revived [moku](https://github.com/hannah-scott/moku) to process the RSS feed — a full evening of using my weird little tools 🙂

1. My mentoring session was incredibly helpful. We chatted about the diagnosis, my needs from work, when I should adapt my behavior vs. changing my environment 💻
2. I went skating at lunchtime with a local trans group, which was fucking awesome 🛹
3. Partner and I had easy dinner and watched _Cunk on Earth_ — funny chill evening 📺

## 2023-08-24

Still unwell with — whatever the fuck this is. I hate being unwell!

1. I booked a flat viewing for me and my partner. Super early stages but we're hoping to get some idea of what we're looking for, where works for us, that kind of thing 🏠
2. I had an ADHD medication appointment which turned out just to be the pre-appointment — that wasn't communicated to me. A little frustrating, but it's a step towards where I want to be 💊
3. My partner made this super delicious stir fry with spiced lime vegan meatballs that was just so fresh and delicious 🥘

My laptop is finally on her last legs and has started making the BAD suspicious noises, so there may be a brief break in my posting these while I get a more stable computer setup.

1. <details>
<summary>mh-</summary>
A pretty bad mental health day today, for a number of reasons — not least of which I've slept poorly. So one of the my good things today is the lovely nap I took after work that lifted my mood substantiall 🛌
</details>
2. I finished We Had To Remove This Post, which was really very good if horrifying and tragic. I've started Count Zero next: a different kind of cybernetic horror, maybe 📖
3. My partner has been as amazing and loving as they usually are in helping me when I have been having a tough time recently. So, them! 💜

1. Made plans to go to the cinema with a friend this weekend 📽️
2. I did a legitimate "no walking" run today and am feeling strong 🏃‍♀️
3. Went to a friend's for dinner, which was lovely. We hung out and chatted and watched some _Old Enough!_, the Japanese show where kids do errands for their parents 🍝

1. Ate lunch outside today and enjoyed the sun 🌞
2. Played some more SSX Tricky, that game is so good 🏂
3. Had a really cute date — we hung out in the park for a while, met some dogs, then went to see Barbie 💖

## 2023-08-20

1. I went and got breakfast with my partner from a nearby cafe, played some table tennis and went for a walk by the water for a while 🌳
2. Partner and I refreshed our undercuts ✂️
3. My partner and I went to see boygenius play at Gunnersbury Park. It was basically a cool queer festival: good vibes, great music, nice food! A significant percentage of the polycule was there but signal was pretty bad. We managed to find my girlfriend though! 💜

## 2023-08-19

I was ill again today and stayed in, which was a bit trying but for the best. Hopefully I'll be well enough for a gig tomorrow.

1. I did some more work on the D&D campaign, including watching some videos on Hitman's level design. It's a shame they're all good-aligned, I kind of want to do assassination ideas now 😅
2. I got PCSX2 working — completely legally, of course — and spent the evening playing THUG and SSX Tricky 🎮
3. My partner and I got takeaway ramen for dinner 🍜

## 2023-08-18

I was pretty unwell today unfortunately, which derailed my plans a little. I had to cancel seeing my girlfriend — that felt pretty shitty.

1. Went to see a friend in the morning, and while I ended up having to leave early because I was feeling unwell we did have some pastries and coffee together ☕
2. I started learning about COBOL and wrote a 2th-inspired calendar CLI in it 💻
3. My partner and I got pizza and watched Game Changer 📺

1. I ordered some more film and it has now arrived! So I went for a lovely photo walk with a cheap half-frame camera 📷
2. My friend and I had our first book club session — we're reading Calling Bullshit. I started making notes and ended up writing about 1,500 words of character assassination on these authors so, good choice 📖
3. Two friends came round for dinner and hung out. They're not in the city for long so I'm trying to make the most of their proximity while they're here 🙂

2. Started reading the latest issue of _Branch_ from Climate Action Tech. I've been doing lots of good reading recently 📖
3. I went on a wonderful 2nd date with someone. We went to a metal bar, got food, chilled in the park: blissful 🌳

1. My partner was home ill today, which was obviously not pleasant but it did mean that I got to spend more time with them in the house 🙂
2. I went for a run, which was great — and started putting together a more robust set of training notes for the marathon 🏃‍♀
3. I had my ADHD assessment today, and ended up with a diagnosis. I'm honestly still not sure how I feel about it — I guess I'll know more when I've spoken to specialists and prescribing doctors — but it's never a bad thing to have more information about my own brain 🧠

Perlite doesn't look great in surf. I'm also not sure what the advantage of publishing my notes is, beyond what I already write up. I understand the advantages of personal wikis — I don't see the advantage to "writing for an audience".

## 2023-08-14

This week is my partner's four-day working week, so they were at home. Working from home is so much nicer knowing they're around.

1. Made plans to go see Barbie tomorrow with my partner and girlfriend 💖
2. I did a lot of preparation for my D&D campaign (which ended up being postponed for a few days) 🎲
3. My partner and I had burgers and watched old Monster Factory episodes. I played some No Man's Sky. Just chilled out, living a weed-free stoner lifestyle 📺

I'm finding Obsidian to be excellent for the kind of work that D&D campaign preparation involves, particularly the canvas view. It's also a lot more performant than Standard Notes or logseq were on my phone, which.In principle I really like logseq, in practice the mobile app wasn't super usable. It's a shame. I much prefer how it organises to-dos and handles daily journalling.

## 2023-08-13

1. Church was super chill today. A surprisingly large number of people: we had an interesting preach and took communion together ⛪
2. My friend met me after church and we went to the park together to eat galettes and catch up. We chatted about what we were reading, how life is going, work 🌳
3. I cooked for myself, my partner and girlfriend, and my friend and her boyfriend. It was lovely to just hang out with everyone, cook for them, chat and laugh. A beautiful evening 🥘

## 2023-08-12

1. I had a first date today with someone from the apps and it went so well. She was so cool! We went to a cute cafe and hung out in the park petting dogs — chill times ☺️
2. Had delicious lunch at a nearby cafe and chilled in the sun 🌞
3. My partner and I watched _They Cloned Tyrone_: hilarious and super socially conscious, with fantastic performances. It also looked incredible. Highly recommend it 📽️

## 2023-08-11

1. I went skating after work and landed some BS shuvits, which I must have last done like 6 years ago or something 🛹
2. My partner had a date, so I watched stuff they wouldn't be in to. Ended up going through the first episode of The Rehearsal, and the third instalment in the God's Not Dead series, which honestly was kinda watchable compared to the first two 📽
3. I ate dinner in the park and chilled in the sunset 🥖

2. Partner and I had friends over, we played Catan and ate arepas 🎲
3. I implemented some seasonal stylesheets on my website 🖥

## 2023-08-09

1. Had a day in the office with my team today, which I had organised. It went really well, we got a lot done and it was nice seeing everyone in person 💻
2. Went for a drink with work people afterwards, which was fun 🍻
3. Watched some TV and had delicious Mediterranean vegetable pasta for dinner pasta 🍝

## 2023-08-06

1. Church was super relaxed and chilled out today, which honestly I needed — I'm so tired… sang some songs and caught up with folks ⛪
2. I went to the park and got lunch from a great food stall, chatted to the person who works there for a bit then sat in the sun and ate 🌞
3. I went to see my girlfriend! We had a lovely dinner and started the new season of _The Bear_ 🐻

## 2023-08-04

1. Made plans with my friend to start a book club, and suggested a couple of things for our first book 📖
2. Knees and ankles are both absolutely wrecked so no skating or running today, but I did bike to a nearby green space to eat my lunch and listen to Trashfuture 🌳
3. My partner and I got pizza for dinner from a place that does cheesy garlic bread with olives 🍕

2. I baked some tofu until it was super crispy and served it with a roasted pepper vegan mac & cheese. Turned out really nicely 🫑
3. I started trying out anki and spaced repetition as a general note-taking system, a way to reinforce patterns and practices. I'm interested to see how it works 🙂

Today marks a year of Three Good Things, so — happy anniversary 🙂

1. I got up and made nice coffee, and had some of the peanut butter snacks my parents brought ☕
2. My partner and I went to London zoo for the day — we saw loads of cool animals, including some cool glasswing butterflies. I'm not the biggest fan of zoos but today was really lovely 🦋
3. We watched What's Love Got To Do With It? which was pretty good, and some very chill youtube videos by tanks for nothin setting up fishtanks 🐌
