<summary>cw: Gaza conflict</summary>
I wrote to my local MP about the Palestinian genocide. I don't feel "good" about any of this, but it does at least feel like I'm doing _something_ to make some difference. I really hope it helps, in some way 🙂
</details>
3. I have the second day of my climbing course tonight! Excited/nervous, we're doing overhangs which are _not_ my idea of a good time. But fingers crossed I'll grow to love them 🧗‍♀

2. Church service was absolutely beautiful — and one of my friends played the organ, gorgeous! ⛪

1. My friend is staying with us at the moment, so we got to hang out and catch up 🙂

1. Church was really lovely today, sung worship had a real sense of energy and community and the sermon was challenging and interesting and queer ⛪

3. Went to a left-leaning indie bookshop nearby and bought a copy of _How Europe Underdeveloped Africa_, as well as hearing about a couple of reading groups I might get involved in. I've been thinking for a while about my lack of involvement in left spaces, and how that's something I want to change — so here we go, let's change that! 📚

## 2023-10-14

1. I went bouldering at a new climbing gym. They had trans and queer flags up, the couple people I spoke to were friendly, and I sent a tough V0 🏳‍⚧
2. I made pasta for myself and my partner — tofu, mushroom and green beans. I'm trying to cut down on salt at the moment for my high BP, so I'm doing a lot of cooking and it's been really grounding. Cooking for me is a practice of self-care and care for my loved ones 🍝
3. I fixed whatever was wrong with my bootloader and got my laptop back up and running — don't die on me yet baby! So I was able to ssh into the machine that hosts this website and update some stuff: certs, three good things, &c. 💻

1. I cooked shepherd's pie for myself and my partner — it turned out so good! 🥘
2. I went for a bike ride 🚲

### _Celeste_ Corner

I'm sitting on a 42:XX right now, which is great. Absolutely crushing. Good practice on Ridge today, but I'm very variable in all the chapters to be honest. I'll go from a 5:30 Temple to like, a 7:30 Temple in a single session. This is just consistency — just practice. I'll get there 🙂

## 2023-09-21

1. I had a follow-up call with my mortgage advisor — and have been approved! 🏠
2. My girlfriend and I went out for dinner together. It was pouring it down, and the front of the restaurant ended up flooding — we had to cross the water over a makeshift bridge of wooden pallets. The food was so delicious — smoky, rich, exactly what I needed 🔥
3. We had a polycule-&-friends cinema trip to see _Alucarda_, a queer nunsploitation film. It was hilarious, sexy and weird — perfect! 📽

### _Celeste_ Corner

Did some practice runs today focusing on Temple, and got a 47:XX which isn't bad. There's a lot of variability in my times, particularly Ridge, Temple and Summit — I think that's where I need to focus work.

## 2023-09-20

1. I gave a presentation at work around D&I work I've been doing, and it went really well 💻

2. My partner and I played _Stardew Valley_ together 🎮
3. I spoke over text with my close friend about what we've been reading, doing, thinking — it's always a joy to talk to her 🙂

## 2023-09-02

Reader, I am once again unwell.

1. My partner had a very early start today which meant I was awake around 6:15 this morning. So I watched the first episodes of a few animes — I enjoyed the _Rurouni Kenshin_ remake a fair amount, and loved both _Chainsaw Man_ and _Salaryman's Club_ 📺
2. I played a bunch of _OlliOlli World_, which can best be described as a "build-a-queer" simulator: every player character has an undeniably trans quality 🎮
3. I finished [_Eileen_](/books/fiction/eileen.html), which I actually quite enjoyed — although not as much as [_Rest and Relaxation_](/books/fiction/my-year-of-rest-and-relaxation.html) — and have started _Acts of Service_ 📚

1. I played some _Blasphemous_ yesterday, it's a good midpoint between challenging and **too** challenging for me 🎮

3. I got home from my date and did the first day of a 30-day yoga course online. I don't know if I'll finish this ([SOFA](/sofa.html)) but we'll see 🙂

1. I got out of the city and went for a walk in the forest with a couple of women from church. It was such a beautiful day, loads of beech and oak trees. I was also very happy I'd downloaded Organic Maps before going, because we did end up getting a litle lost and it came in so handy having the trails mapped out 🌳
2. I listened to _Punisher_ by Phoebe Bridgers. I've never really taken the time to listen to Phoebe's music, despite loving boygenius, but it's really growing on me this time round 🎧

1. My partner and I went to look at a flat this morning — it wasn't really for us, but it was lovely to be taking steps towards where we need to be, and I think we both now have more of an idea of what we _do_ want from a house 🏠
2. We went and got breakfast from a lovely cafe nearby: I had a bagel and they got some french toast, and we drank some coffee and listened to the bangers they had going on the radio ☕
3. My partner is on a date so I've written up a couple of book reviews, done some maintenance on the site, and now my plan is just to chill out. I've had a busy couple of weeks, it's kind of refreshing not to have anything to do other than relax 😪

I updated all my old notes with links and emojis, as well as adding content warnings to some posts that contain potentially triggering shit. They look like this:

Today I wrote an extra function for [lark](https://github.com/hannah-scott/lark) to handle conversion to markdown, and then used that to move all of this over to markdown. So moving forward this is going to be markdown — I'm using Obsidian to write all of this stuff so it makes more sense, IMO.

I also revived [moku](https://github.com/hannah-scott/moku) to process the RSS feed — a full evening of using my weird little tools 🙂

1. My mentoring session was incredibly helpful. We chatted about the diagnosis, my needs from work, when I should adapt my behavior vs. changing my environment 💻
2. I went skating at lunchtime with a local trans group, which was fucking awesome 🛹
3. Partner and I had easy dinner and watched _Cunk on Earth_ — funny chill evening 📺

## 2023-08-24

Still unwell with — whatever the fuck this is. I hate being unwell!

1. I booked a flat viewing for me and my partner. Super early stages but we're hoping to get some idea of what we're looking for, where works for us, that kind of thing 🏠
2. I had an ADHD medication appointment which turned out just to be the pre-appointment — that wasn't communicated to me. A little frustrating, but it's a step towards where I want to be 💊
3. My partner made this super delicious stir fry with spiced lime vegan meatballs that was just so fresh and delicious 🥘

My laptop is finally on her last legs and has started making the BAD suspicious noises, so there may be a brief break in my posting these while I get a more stable computer setup.

1. <details>
<summary>mh-</summary>
A pretty bad mental health day today, for a number of reasons — not least of which I've slept poorly. So one of the my good things today is the lovely nap I took after work that lifted my mood substantiall 🛌
</details>
2. I finished We Had To Remove This Post, which was really very good if horrifying and tragic. I've started Count Zero next: a different kind of cybernetic horror, maybe 📖
3. My partner has been as amazing and loving as they usually are in helping me when I have been having a tough time recently. So, them! 💜

1. I went and got breakfast with my partner from a nearby cafe, played some table tennis and went for a walk by the water for a while 🌳
2. Partner and I refreshed our undercuts ✂️
3. My partner and I went to see boygenius play at Gunnersbury Park. It was basically a cool queer festival: good vibes, great music, nice food! A significant percentage of the polycule was there but signal was pretty bad. We managed to find my girlfriend though! 💜

## 2023-08-19

I was ill again today and stayed in, which was a bit trying but for the best. Hopefully I'll be well enough for a gig tomorrow.

1. I did some more work on the D&D campaign, including watching some videos on Hitman's level design. It's a shame they're all good-aligned, I kind of want to do assassination ideas now 😅
2. I got PCSX2 working — completely legally, of course — and spent the evening playing THUG and SSX Tricky 🎮
3. My partner and I got takeaway ramen for dinner 🍜

I was pretty unwell today unfortunately, which derailed my plans a little. I had to cancel seeing my girlfriend — that felt pretty shitty.

1. Went to see a friend in the morning, and while I ended up having to leave early because I was feeling unwell we did have some pastries and coffee together ☕
2. I started learning about COBOL and wrote a 2th-inspired calendar CLI in it 💻

1. I ordered some more film and it has now arrived! So I went for a lovely photo walk with a cheap half-frame camera 📷
2. My friend and I had our first book club session — we're reading Calling Bullshit. I started making notes and ended up writing about 1,500 words of character assassination on these authors so, good choice 📖
3. Two friends came round for dinner and hung out. They're not in the city for long so I'm trying to make the most of their proximity while they're here 🙂

1. Had a super productive day at work today, including getting VSCode actually working on my laptop and skating to the shops to pick up coffee ☕
2. Started reading the latest issue of _Branch_ from Climate Action Tech. I've been doing lots of good reading recently 📖
3. I went on a wonderful 2nd date with someone. We went to a metal bar, got food, chilled in the park: blissful 🌳

1. My partner was home ill today, which was obviously not pleasant but it did mean that I got to spend more time with them in the house 🙂
2. I went for a run, which was great — and started putting together a more robust set of training notes for the marathon 🏃‍♀
3. I had my ADHD assessment today, and ended up with a diagnosis. I'm honestly still not sure how I feel about it — I guess I'll know more when I've spoken to specialists and prescribing doctors — but it's never a bad thing to have more information about my own brain 🧠

Perlite doesn't look great in surf. I'm also not sure what the advantage of publishing my notes is, beyond what I already write up. I understand the advantages of personal wikis — I don't see the advantage to "writing for an audience".

## 2023-08-14

This week is my partner's four-day working week, so they were at home. Working from home is so much nicer knowing they're around.

1. Made plans to go see Barbie tomorrow with my partner and girlfriend 💖
2. I did a lot of preparation for my D&D campaign (which ended up being postponed for a few days) 🎲
3. My partner and I had burgers and watched old Monster Factory episodes. I played some No Man's Sky. Just chilled out, living a weed-free stoner lifestyle 📺

I'm finding Obsidian to be excellent for the kind of work that D&D campaign preparation involves, particularly the canvas view. It's also a lot more performant than Standard Notes or logseq were on my phone, which.In principle I really like logseq, in practice the mobile app wasn't super usable. It's a shame. I much prefer how it organises to-dos and handles daily journalling.

## 2023-08-13

1. Church was super chill today. A surprisingly large number of people: we had an interesting preach and took communion together ⛪
2. My friend met me after church and we went to the park together to eat galettes and catch up. We chatted about what we were reading, how life is going, work 🌳
3. I cooked for myself, my partner and girlfriend, and my friend and her boyfriend. It was lovely to just hang out with everyone, cook for them, chat and laugh. A beautiful evening 🥘

## 2023-08-12

1. I had a first date today with someone from the apps and it went so well. She was so cool! We went to a cute cafe and hung out in the park petting dogs — chill times ☺️
2. Had delicious lunch at a nearby cafe and chilled in the sun 🌞
3. My partner and I watched _They Cloned Tyrone_: hilarious and super socially conscious, with fantastic performances. It also looked incredible. Highly recommend it 📽️

I finished the introduction to _Seeing like a State_ today. It's exploring an idea that I've heard a lot about before — legibility — in much more detail than I've ever thought about it.

## 2023-08-11

1. I went skating after work and landed some BS shuvits, which I must have last done like 6 years ago or something 🛹
2. My partner had a date, so I watched stuff they wouldn't be in to. Ended up going through the first episode of The Rehearsal, and the third instalment in the God's Not Dead series, which honestly was kinda watchable compared to the first two 📽
3. I ate dinner in the park and chilled in the sunset 🥖

## 2023-08-10

1. I went skating at lunch. It was baking hot but super fun 🛹
2. Partner and I had friends over, we played Catan and ate arepas 🎲
3. I implemented some seasonal stylesheets on my website 🖥

## 2023-08-09

1. Had a day in the office with my team today, which I had organised. It went really well, we got a lot done and it was nice seeing everyone in person 💻
2. Went for a drink with work people afterwards, which was fun 🍻
3. Watched some TV and had delicious Mediterranean vegetable pasta for dinner pasta 🍝

1. I completed the prework for my ADHD assessment next week, looking forward to having that conversation 🧠
2. <details>

I had a panic attack — bad — but this motivated my to build a JS-free tool to do breathing exercises — good! 🌬

3. My girlfriend and I saw _Oppenheimer_ — it was pretty good! She described it as "physicist Avengers", which is entirely fair 📽

1. In polyamorous news, I'm back on the apps and possibly have a date! Early dating is so fun and exciting and new, turns out people are pretty cool and interesting — who knew? 🙂
2. <details>

I got my injection sorted. The practice nurse at my doctor's is such a friendly person 👩‍⚕️

3. Made plans to go see _Oppenheimer_ with my girlfriend, and to see my friend this weekend. Busy social times! 📆

I'm also acquired a copy of _Calling Bullshit_ for my book club. It's interesting: I think there's influence from David Graeber's fantastic book, but a lot more politically toothless based on the first couple of chapters.

## 2023-08-06

1. Church was super relaxed and chilled out today, which honestly I needed — I'm so tired… sang some songs and caught up with folks ⛪
2. I went to the park and got lunch from a great food stall, chatted to the person who works there for a bit then sat in the sun and ate 🌞
3. I went to see my girlfriend! We had a lovely dinner and started the new season of _The Bear_ 🐻

1. Partner and I did a kind of big house tidy, it looks so lovely 🏠
2. We went to a nearby cafe, I had a really good bagel and a pistachio pain au chocolat 🥐
3. We went to our social sibling's birthday party, which was a costume party! I was Lara Croft and so were they 🔫

## 2023-08-04

1. Made plans with my friend to start a book club, and suggested a couple of things for our first book 📖
2. Knees and ankles are both absolutely wrecked so no skating or running today, but I did bike to a nearby green space to eat my lunch and listen to Trashfuture 🌳
3. My partner and I got pizza for dinner from a place that does cheesy garlic bread with olives 🍕

This friend was trying to get in while I was working, which — I admire the energy, yeah. Took some self-control not to make a friend with a squirrel. I kinda regret it, really. Squirrel-friend would be cool.

1. My partner and I got almond croissants from a coffee shop nearby for breakfast 🥐
2. I skated a lot today: chatted to someone I knew at the park, hit some rock to fakies for the first time in a while, and rolled into a quarterpipe for the first time ever 🛹
3. My partner came to meet me at the skatepark and brought some drinks, so we hung out in the park enjoying the evening sun and chilling 🍻

1. I cooked a pretty great aubergine and chickpea curry with chapatti — a couple days of cooking in a row is doing nice things for my mental health, so I might try to keep that up for a while 🍽
2. I made plans for this weekend with my girlfriend 💜
3. I went for a run after work. Running around the park through mud and with a slight chill in the air has me excited for autumn 🏃‍♀

1. I went skating at lunch, chatted to a couple people at the park and got talked into trying out some roll-on grinds. Those are insanely fucking fun! It's meant to rain for the next few days, so it was good to get some skating in before then 🛹
2. I baked some tofu until it was super crispy and served it with a roasted pepper vegan mac & cheese. Turned out really nicely 🫑
3. I started trying out anki and spaced repetition as a general note-taking system, a way to reinforce patterns and practices. I'm interested to see how it works 🙂

1. I got my markup language lark to a releasable state, so — it's out! A couple changes to how blocks work, and a much cleaner implenentation 💻
2. My parents brought me a guitar so my partner and I have been singing — mostly boygenius, but I sang some Pat the Bunny songs too 🎸
3. My partner made this gorgeous green bean and pasta dish with cooked lemons 🍝

## 2023-07-30

Today marks a year of Three Good Things, so — happy anniversary 🙂

1. I got up and made nice coffee, and had some of the peanut butter snacks my parents brought ☕
2. My partner and I went to London zoo for the day — we saw loads of cool animals, including some cool glasswing butterflies. I'm not the biggest fan of zoos but today was really lovely 🦋
3. We watched What's Love Got To Do With It? which was pretty good, and some very chill youtube videos by tanks for nothin setting up fishtanks 🐌
