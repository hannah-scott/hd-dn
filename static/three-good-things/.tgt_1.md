1. I got out of the city and went for a walk in the forest with a couple of women from church. It was such a beautiful day, loads of beech and oak trees. I was also very happy I'd downloaded Organic Maps before going, because we did end up getting a litle lost and it came in so handy having the trails mapped out 🌳
2. I listened to _Punisher_ by Phoebe Bridgers. I've never really taken the time to listen to Phoebe's music, despite loving boygenius, but it's really growing on me this time round 🎧

I didn't eat much today, so my partner made us a big pasta dish for dinner with pesto, tofu, green beans and olives: it was so good! 🍝

1. I ate pie for breakfast, drank coffee and watched some of an hbomberguy video 🍏
2. My friend, girlfriend and partner all went to the cinema, we say _Fresh Kill_ which was a fantastic slice of lesbian '90s cyberpunkiness 👩‍💻
3. I had some fun in a bookshop with my partner, and started reading _Eileen_ by Ottessa Moshfegh 📖

1. My partner and I went to look at a flat this morning — it wasn't really for us, but it was lovely to be taking steps towards where we need to be, and I think we both now have more of an idea of what we _do_ want from a house 🏠
2. We went and got breakfast from a lovely cafe nearby: I had a bagel and they got some french toast, and we drank some coffee and listened to the bangers they had going on the radio ☕
3. My partner is on a date so I've written up a couple of book reviews, done some maintenance on the site, and now my plan is just to chill out. I've had a busy couple of weeks, it's kind of refreshing not to have anything to do other than relax 😪

I updated all my old notes with links and emojis, as well as adding content warnings to some posts that contain potentially triggering shit. They look like this:

I'm using [Linter](https://github.com/platers/obsidian-linter) with Obsidian, which happens to include custom regex — so just wrote some regex that makes these super easy to insert.

Today I wrote an extra function for [lark](https://github.com/hannah-scott/lark) to handle conversion to markdown, and then used that to move all of this over to markdown. So moving forward this is going to be markdown — I'm using Obsidian to write all of this stuff so it makes more sense, IMO.

I also revived [moku](https://github.com/hannah-scott/moku) to process the RSS feed — a full evening of using my weird little tools 🙂

1. My mentoring session was incredibly helpful. We chatted about the diagnosis, my needs from work, when I should adapt my behavior vs. changing my environment 💻
2. I went skating at lunchtime with a local trans group, which was fucking awesome 🛹
3. Partner and I had easy dinner and watched _Cunk on Earth_ — funny chill evening 📺

## 2023-08-24

Still unwell with — whatever the fuck this is. I hate being unwell!

1. I booked a flat viewing for me and my partner. Super early stages but we're hoping to get some idea of what we're looking for, where works for us, that kind of thing 🏠
2. I had an ADHD medication appointment which turned out just to be the pre-appointment — that wasn't communicated to me. A little frustrating, but it's a step towards where I want to be 💊
3. My partner made this super delicious stir fry with spiced lime vegan meatballs that was just so fresh and delicious 🥘

My laptop is finally on her last legs and has started making the BAD suspicious noises, so there may be a brief break in my posting these while I get a more stable computer setup.

1. <details>
<summary>mh-</summary>
A pretty bad mental health day today, for a number of reasons — not least of which I've slept poorly. So one of the my good things today is the lovely nap I took after work that lifted my mood substantiall 🛌
</details>
2. I finished We Had To Remove This Post, which was really very good if horrifying and tragic. I've started Count Zero next: a different kind of cybernetic horror, maybe 📖
3. My partner has been as amazing and loving as they usually are in helping me when I have been having a tough time recently. So, them! 💜

1. Made plans to go to the cinema with a friend this weekend 📽️
2. I did a legitimate "no walking" run today and am feeling strong 🏃‍♀️
3. Went to a friend's for dinner, which was lovely. We hung out and chatted and watched some _Old Enough!_, the Japanese show where kids do errands for their parents 🍝

1. Ate lunch outside today and enjoyed the sun 🌞
2. Played some more SSX Tricky, that game is so good 🏂
3. Had a really cute date — we hung out in the park for a while, met some dogs, then went to see Barbie 💖

## 2023-08-20

1. I went and got breakfast with my partner from a nearby cafe, played some table tennis and went for a walk by the water for a while 🌳
2. Partner and I refreshed our undercuts ✂️
3. My partner and I went to see boygenius play at Gunnersbury Park. It was basically a cool queer festival: good vibes, great music, nice food! A significant percentage of the polycule was there but signal was pretty bad. We managed to find my girlfriend though! 💜

## 2023-08-19

I was ill again today and stayed in, which was a bit trying but for the best. Hopefully I'll be well enough for a gig tomorrow.

1. I did some more work on the D&D campaign, including watching some videos on Hitman's level design. It's a shame they're all good-aligned, I kind of want to do assassination ideas now 😅
2. I got PCSX2 working — completely legally, of course — and spent the evening playing THUG and SSX Tricky 🎮
3. My partner and I got takeaway ramen for dinner 🍜

## 2023-08-18

I was pretty unwell today unfortunately, which derailed my plans a little. I had to cancel seeing my girlfriend — that felt pretty shitty.

1. Went to see a friend in the morning, and while I ended up having to leave early because I was feeling unwell we did have some pastries and coffee together ☕
2. I started learning about COBOL and wrote a 2th-inspired calendar CLI in it 💻
3. My partner and I got pizza and watched Game Changer 📺

## 2023-08-17

1. I ordered some more film and it has now arrived! So I went for a lovely photo walk with a cheap half-frame camera 📷
2. My friend and I had our first book club session — we're reading Calling Bullshit. I started making notes and ended up writing about 1,500 words of character assassination on these authors so, good choice 📖
3. Two friends came round for dinner and hung out. They're not in the city for long so I'm trying to make the most of their proximity while they're here 🙂

1. Had a super productive day at work today, including getting VSCode actually working on my laptop and skating to the shops to pick up coffee ☕
2. Started reading the latest issue of _Branch_ from Climate Action Tech. I've been doing lots of good reading recently 📖
3. I went on a wonderful 2nd date with someone. We went to a metal bar, got food, chilled in the park: blissful 🌳

1. My partner was home ill today, which was obviously not pleasant but it did mean that I got to spend more time with them in the house 🙂
2. I went for a run, which was great — and started putting together a more robust set of training notes for the marathon 🏃‍♀
3. I had my ADHD assessment today, and ended up with a diagnosis. I'm honestly still not sure how I feel about it — I guess I'll know more when I've spoken to specialists and prescribing doctors — but it's never a bad thing to have more information about my own brain 🧠

Perlite doesn't look great in surf. I'm also not sure what the advantage of publishing my notes is, beyond what I already write up. I understand the advantages of personal wikis — I don't see the advantage to "writing for an audience".

## 2023-08-14

This week is my partner's four-day working week, so they were at home. Working from home is so much nicer knowing they're around.

1. Made plans to go see Barbie tomorrow with my partner and girlfriend 💖
2. I did a lot of preparation for my D&D campaign (which ended up being postponed for a few days) 🎲
3. My partner and I had burgers and watched old Monster Factory episodes. I played some No Man's Sky. Just chilled out, living a weed-free stoner lifestyle 📺

I'm finding Obsidian to be excellent for the kind of work that D&D campaign preparation involves, particularly the canvas view. It's also a lot more performant than Standard Notes or logseq were on my phone, which.In principle I really like logseq, in practice the mobile app wasn't super usable. It's a shame. I much prefer how it organises to-dos and handles daily journalling.

## 2023-08-13

1. Church was super chill today. A surprisingly large number of people: we had an interesting preach and took communion together ⛪
2. My friend met me after church and we went to the park together to eat galettes and catch up. We chatted about what we were reading, how life is going, work 🌳
3. I cooked for myself, my partner and girlfriend, and my friend and her boyfriend. It was lovely to just hang out with everyone, cook for them, chat and laugh. A beautiful evening 🥘

## 2023-08-12

1. I had a first date today with someone from the apps and it went so well. She was so cool! We went to a cute cafe and hung out in the park petting dogs — chill times ☺️
2. Had delicious lunch at a nearby cafe and chilled in the sun 🌞
3. My partner and I watched _They Cloned Tyrone_: hilarious and super socially conscious, with fantastic performances. It also looked incredible. Highly recommend it 📽️

I finished the introduction to _Seeing like a State_ today. It's exploring an idea that I've heard a lot about before — legibility — in much more detail than I've ever thought about it.

## 2023-08-11

1. I went skating after work and landed some BS shuvits, which I must have last done like 6 years ago or something 🛹
2. My partner had a date, so I watched stuff they wouldn't be in to. Ended up going through the first episode of The Rehearsal, and the third instalment in the God's Not Dead series, which honestly was kinda watchable compared to the first two 📽
3. I ate dinner in the park and chilled in the sunset 🥖

## 2023-08-10

1. I went skating at lunch. It was baking hot but super fun 🛹
2. Partner and I had friends over, we played Catan and ate arepas 🎲
3. I implemented some seasonal stylesheets on my website 🖥

## 2023-08-09

1. Had a day in the office with my team today, which I had organised. It went really well, we got a lot done and it was nice seeing everyone in person 💻
2. Went for a drink with work people afterwards, which was fun 🍻
3. Watched some TV and had delicious Mediterranean vegetable pasta for dinner pasta 🍝

I'm also acquired a copy of _Calling Bullshit_ for my book club. It's interesting: I think there's influence from David Graeber's fantastic book, but a lot more politically toothless based on the first couple of chapters.

## 2023-08-06

1. Church was super relaxed and chilled out today, which honestly I needed — I'm so tired… sang some songs and caught up with folks ⛪
2. I went to the park and got lunch from a great food stall, chatted to the person who works there for a bit then sat in the sun and ate 🌞
3. I went to see my girlfriend! We had a lovely dinner and started the new season of _The Bear_ 🐻

3. We went to our social sibling's birthday party, which was a costume party! I was Lara Croft and so were they 🔫

## 2023-08-04

1. Made plans with my friend to start a book club, and suggested a couple of things for our first book 📖
2. Knees and ankles are both absolutely wrecked so no skating or running today, but I did bike to a nearby green space to eat my lunch and listen to Trashfuture 🌳
3. My partner and I got pizza for dinner from a place that does cheesy garlic bread with olives 🍕

2. I skated a lot today: chatted to someone I knew at the park, hit some rock to fakies for the first time in a while, and rolled into a quarterpipe for the first time ever 🛹
3. My partner came to meet me at the skatepark and brought some drinks, so we hung out in the park enjoying the evening sun and chilling 🍻

2. I made plans for this weekend with my girlfriend 💜
3. I went for a run after work. Running around the park through mud and with a slight chill in the air has me excited for autumn 🏃‍♀

1. I went skating at lunch, chatted to a couple people at the park and got talked into trying out some roll-on grinds. Those are insanely fucking fun! It's meant to rain for the next few days, so it was good to get some skating in before then 🛹
2. I baked some tofu until it was super crispy and served it with a roasted pepper vegan mac & cheese. Turned out really nicely 🫑
3. I started trying out anki and spaced repetition as a general note-taking system, a way to reinforce patterns and practices. I'm interested to see how it works 🙂

Today marks a year of Three Good Things, so — happy anniversary 🙂

1. I got up and made nice coffee, and had some of the peanut butter snacks my parents brought ☕
2. My partner and I went to London zoo for the day — we saw loads of cool animals, including some cool glasswing butterflies. I'm not the biggest fan of zoos but today was really lovely 🦋
3. We watched What's Love Got To Do With It? which was pretty good, and some very chill youtube videos by tanks for nothin setting up fishtanks 🐌
