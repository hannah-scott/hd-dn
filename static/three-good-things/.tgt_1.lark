: My partner was home ill today, which was obviously not pleasant but it did mean that I got to spend more time with them in the house 🙂
: I went for a run, which was great --- and started putting together a more robust set of training notes for the marathon 🏃‍♀
: I had my ADHD assessment today, and ended up with a diagnosis. I'm honestly still not sure how I feel about it --- I guess I'll know more when I've spoken to specialists and prescribing doctors --- but it's never a bad thing to have more information about my own brain 🧠

Perlite doesn't look great in surf. I'm also not sure what the advantage of publishing my notes is, beyond what I already write up. I understand the advantages of personal wikis --- I don't see the advantage to "writing for an audience".

This week is my partner's four-day working week, so they were at home. Working from home is so much nicer knowing they're around.

: Made plans to go see Barbie tomorrow with my partner and girlfriend 💖
: I did a lot of preparation for my D&D campaign (which ended up being postponed for a few days) 🎲
: My partner and I had burgers and watched old Monster Factory episodes. I played some No Man's Sky. Just chilled out, living a weed-free stoner lifestyle 📺

I'm finding Obsidian to be excellent for the kind of work that D&D campaign preparation involves, particularly the canvas view. It's also a lot more performant than Standard Notes or logseq were on my phone, which.

In principle I really like logseq, in practice the mobile app wasn't super usable. It's a shame. I much prefer how it organises to-dos and handles daily journalling.

: Church was super chill today. A surprisingly large number of people: we had an interesting preach and took communion together ⛪
: My friend met me after church and we went to the park together to eat galettes and catch up. We chatted about what we were reading, how life is going, work 🌳
: I cooked for myself, my partner and girlfriend, and my friend and her boyfriend. It was lovely to just hang out with everyone, cook for them, chat and laugh. A beautiful evening 🥘

: I had a first date today with someone from the apps and it went so well. She was so cool! We went to a cute cafe and hung out in the park petting dogs -- chill times ☺️
: Had delicious lunch at a nearby cafe and chilled in the sun 🌞
: My partner and I watched They Cloned Tyrone: hilarious and super socially conscious, with fantastic performances. It also looked incredible. Highly recommend it 📽️

I finished the introduction to Seeing like a State today. It's exploring an idea that I've heard a lot about before --- legibility --- in much more detail than I've ever thought about it.

:  I went skating after work and landed some BS shuvits, which I must have last done like 6 years ago or something 🛹
:  My partner had a date, so I watched stuff they wouldn't be in to. Ended up going through the first episode of The Rehearsal, and the third instalment in the God's Not Dead series, which honestly was kinda watchable compared to the first two 📽
:  I ate dinner in the park and chilled in the sunset 🥖

:  I completed the prework for my ADHD assessment next week, looking forward to having that conversation 🧠
:  I had a panic attack -- bad -- but this motivated my to build a JS-free tool to do breathing exercises -- good! 🌬
:  My girlfriend and I saw Oppenheimer -- it was pretty good! She described it as "physicist Avengers", which is entirely fair 📽

: In polyamorous news, I'm back on the apps and possibly have a date! Early dating is so fun and exciting and new, turns out people are pretty cool and interesting -- who knew? 🙂
: I got my injection sorted. The practice nurse at my doctor's is such a friendly person 👩‍⚕️
: Made plans to go see Oppenheimer with my girlfriend, and to see my friend this weekend. Busy social times! 📆

@ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/susan-song-polyamory-and-queer-anarchism-infinite-possibilities-for-resistance I reread Polyamory and Queer Anarchism 
@ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/peter-gelderloos-the-poisons-are-already-in-here-with-us and started this transcript of a talk given by Peter Gelderloos

I'm also acquired a copy of Calling Bullshit for my book club. It's interesting: I think there's influence from David Graeber's fantastic book, but a lot more politically toothless based on the first couple of chapters.

: Church was super relaxed and chilled out today, which honestly I needed -- I'm so tired... sang some songs and caught up with folks ⛪
: I went to the park and got lunch from a great food stall, chatted to the person who works there for a bit then sat in the sun and ate 🌞
: I went to see my girlfriend! We had a lovely dinner and started the new season of The Bear 🐻

: Made plans with my friend to start a book club, and suggested a couple of things for our first book 📖
: Knees and ankles are both absolutely wrecked so no skating or running today, but I did bike to a nearby green space to eat my lunch and listen to Trashfuture 🌳
: My partner and I got pizza for dinner from a place that does cheesy garlic bread with olives 🍕

This friend was trying to get in while I was working, which --- I admire the energy, yeah. Took some self-control not to make a friend with a squirrel. I kinda regret it, really. Squirrel-friend would be cool.

: I skated a lot today: chatted to someone I knew at the park, hit some rock to fakies for the first time in a while, and rolled into a quarterpipe for the first time ever 🛹
: My partner came to meet me at the skatepark and brought some ciders, so we hung out in the park enjoying the evening sun and chilling 🍻

:  I cooked a pretty great aubergine and chickpea curry with chapatti --- a couple days of cooking in a row is doing nice things for my mental health, so I might try to keep that up for a while 🍽
:  I made plans for this weekend with my girlfriend 💜
:  I went for a run after work. Running around the park through mud and with a slight chill in the air has me excited for autumn 🏃‍♀

:	I went skating at lunch, chatted to a couple people at the park and got talked into trying out some roll-on grinds. Those are insanely fucking fun! It's meant to rain for the next few days, so it was good to get some skating in before then 🛹
: I baked some tofu until it was super crispy and served it with a roasted pepper vegan mac & cheese. Turned out really nicely 🫑
: I started trying out anki and spaced repetition as a general note-taking system, a way to reinforce patterns and practices. I'm interested to see how it works 🙂
