:  I cooked a pretty great aubergine and chickpea curry with chapatti --- a couple days of cooking in a row is doing nice things for my mental health, so I might try to keep that up for a while 🍽
:  I made plans for this weekend with my girlfriend 💜
:  I went for a run after work. Running around the park through mud and with a slight chill in the air has me excited for autumn 🏃‍♀

I'm trying out Obsidian as a note-taking platform, so far I'm enjoying it.

Not sure how I feel about it yet. It feels odd to choose to use such heavy, closed-source software, but I guess I can always move away to a different Markdown-based solution when an alternative comes up.

:	I went skating at lunch, chatted to a couple people at the park and got talked into trying out some roll-on grinds. Those are insanely fucking fun! It's meant to rain for the next few days, so it was good to get some skating in before then 🛹
: I baked some tofu until it was super crispy and served it with a roasted pepper vegan mac & cheese. Turned out really nicely 🫑
: I started trying out anki and spaced repetition as a general note-taking system, a way to reinforce patterns and practices. I'm interested to see how it works 🙂

Today marks a year of Three Good Things, so --- happy anniversary 🙂

: 	I got up and made nice coffee, and had some of the peanut butter snacks my parents brought ☕
: 	My partner and I went to London zoo for the day --- we saw loads of cool animals, including some cool glasswing butterflies. I'm not the biggest fan of zoos but today was really lovely 🦋
: 	We watched What's Love Got To Do With It? which was pretty good, and some very chill youtube videos by tanks for nothin setting up fishtanks 🐌
