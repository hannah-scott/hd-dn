: I got my markup language lark to a releasable state, so --- it's out! A couple changes to how blocks work, and a much cleaner implenentation 💻
: My parents brought me a guitar so my partner and I have been singing --- mostly boygenius, but I sang some Pat the Bunny songs too 🎸
: My partner made this gorgeous green bean and pasta dish with cooked lemons 🍝

Today marks a year of Three Good Things, so --- happy anniversary 🙂

: 	I got up and made nice coffee, and had some of the peanut butter snacks my parents brought ☕
: 	My partner and I went to London zoo for the day --- we saw loads of cool animals, including some cool glasswing butterflies. I'm not the biggest fan of zoos but today was really lovely 🦋
: 	We watched What's Love Got To Do With It? which was pretty good, and some very chill youtube videos by tanks for nuthin setting up fishtanks 🐌
