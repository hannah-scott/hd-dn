Today marks a year of Three Good Things, so --- happy anniversary 🙂

: 	I got up and made nice coffee, and had some of the peanut butter snacks my parents brought ☕
: 	My partner and I went to London zoo for the day --- we saw loads of cool animals, including some cool glasswing butterflies. I'm not the biggest fan of zoos but today was really lovely 🦋
: 	We watched What's Love Got To Do With It? which was pretty good, and some very chill youtube videos by tanks for nuthin setting up fishtanks 🐌
