1.  I decided to go for a sub-45 in <i>Celeste</i> any%, and got a new PB of 45:43 on my second serious run. I've completely got this.
2.  Made plans to go on holiday in October — and to see a lot of people next week!
3.  I had a sinus headache today, so trying be kind to myself. Ate good food, wrapped up warm, and rested. Making a conscious effort not to shame myself for resting and recovering. On the plus side — I got a cold, it's officially autumn!

1.  Had breakfast with a person, coffee and chill times in the morning. Great start to the day.
2.  I started learning the spike jump and double wall bounce in 4A — wow, spike jumps are easy! I always thought they were way outside my skillset!
3.  I bought a really cute fancy jumpsuit for a work do next week. I'm not the most "trad fancy clothing", but it's nice to dress fancy sometimes!

Had a positive but taxing conversation last night that led to me not getting much sleep, so today I've been focusing on self-care and self-worth.

1.  Got a couple of cheap USB thumbsticks and loaded them up with files to share with friends and loved ones.
2.  I've had a stiff back for a couple of days, so I took time to do stretches and that's really eased it off — maybe something I should do more often?
3.  Read a couple of zines/essays on anarchism and polyamory, <a href="https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/susan-song-polyamory-and-queer-anarchism-infinite-possibilities-for-resistance">Polyamory and Queer Anarchism</a> is a good theoretical primer to go with the emotion and practice of <a href="https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/andie-nordgren-the-short-instructional-manifesto-for-relationship-anarchy">Nordgren</a> . I've been loving the Anarchist Library recently!

I was honestly very dysphoric this morning. So I tried hard to be kind to myself today, and I feel like I did a good job.

1.  I had a delicious lunch, went for a walk, and bought some cursed chewing gum (raspberry and vanilla flavour).
2.  I opted for more old-school tech today: neon pink F91-W over a smartwatch, and my iPod for music. It did really well! Couple of minor memory problems but nothing a reboot couldn't fix.
3.  I went to my queer self-defense class and got a drink with them after — everyone is so lovely and fun.
