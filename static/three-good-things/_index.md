Since July 2022 I've tried to make a habit of noting three good things that have happened throughout the day. This has done good for my mental health, and serves as a nice little diary of my life too!

This page is formatted as an [HTML journal](https://journal.miso.town/), a cool format designed for syndication and micro-blogging. You can subscribe to my three good things with an RSS reader &mdash; the feed is being built.
