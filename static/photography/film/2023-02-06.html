    Shot on a Nikon Nikomat FT. Metering turned out okay on this one (I just
    shot at Sunny 16).

      It gives me a perverse thrill to shoot on this camera just using Sunny 16.
      The FT is a mechanical camera: up until I scan the negatives there are no
      electronics in the process. Maybe it's a product of when I was born, but
      it's so cool to me that I can take a photo without needing something with
      batteries.
