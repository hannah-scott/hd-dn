f Ilford HP5+ @ 400
Shot on a Nikon Nikomat FT. Metering turned out okay on this one (I just shot at Sunny 16).
It gives me a perverse thrill to shoot on this camera just using Sunny 16. The FT is a mechanical camera: up until I scan the negatives there are no electronics in the process. Maybe it's a product of when I was born, but it's so cool to me that I can take a photo without needing something with batteries.
Developed in Rodinal (1:50) for 11:00.
Stopped in Ilfostop for 1:00.
Fixed in Tetenal Super Fix + 1:00+4:00 standing.
