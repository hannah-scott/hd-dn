<h1 class="title">Film Photography</h1>

<p>
  I used to shoot a lot of film between the ages of 16 and 18, very cheap C41
  colour film. I got out of the habit at uni. I found my cameras while going
  through my old things, and have decided to learn how to develop.

  At the moment I'm using a Nikon Nikomat FT. It belonged to my granddad. I've
  had to fix some leaks and the light meter doesn't work, but I love it.

  I developed these pictures myself at home and scanned them in with a pretty
  crappy little Kodak negative scanner. All the dates refer to when I developed
  the roll.
