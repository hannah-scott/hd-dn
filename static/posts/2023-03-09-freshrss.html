      <h1 class="title">FreshRSS</h1>
      <p class="date">2023-03-09</p>

      <p>
        I recently moved from using Feeder (the
        <a
          href="https://f-droid.org/packages/com.nononsenseapps.feeder/"
          target="_blank"
          >open-source app</a
        >, not the online service) as my RSS reader, to a self-hosted instance
        of
        <a href="https://www.freshrss.org/" target="_blank">FreshRSS</a>
        with
        <a
          href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.freshrss.easyrss/"
          target="_blank"
          >EasyRSS</a
        >
        as a client. That process was a little fiddly, so I'm laying out my
        set-up in case it helps anyone (including me).
      </p>

      <h2>Installing & reverse proxy configuration</h2>

      <p>
        My webserver runs on <code>nginx</code> and setup information for
        <code>nginx</code> was a little lacking. I tried getting the
        non-dockerised install to work, but for some reason I wasn't able to get
        the routing right with just flat files. It's possible I misunderstood
        something and this is very easy.
      </p>

      <p>
        For that reason I'm running the dockerised version on port 8080 with
        <code>nginx</code> as a reverse proxy in front of it. My
        <code>.conf</code> file looks like this:
      </p>

      <pre><code>server {
  listen 80;
  listen [::]:80;
  listen 443 ssl http2;
  listen [::]:443 ssl http2;
  
  if ($scheme = http) {
    return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri;
  }
  
  ssl_certificate /path/to/fullchain.pem;
  ssl_certificate_key /path/to/privkey.pem;

  server_name rss.your-domain.com;
  
  location / {
    proxy_pass http://rss.your-domain.com:8080/;
    include proxy_params;
  }
}</code></pre>

      <p>
        This works for what I need it to do, and is simple to upgrade, so I'm
        going to stick with it for now.
      </p>

      <h2>EasyRSS & API integration</h2>

      <p>
        One of the cool features of FreshRSS is that it can integrate with
        third-party RSS readers using the Google Reader API. This is really
        useful for me since I do most of my RSS reader on my phone on the
        underground.
      </p>

      <p>
        I couldn't find a very clear explanation of how to set the API up
        though, so I'm going to do my best to explain it here:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Log into the FreshRSS web application as an admin</li>
        <li>Go to <i>Settings > Administration > Authentication</i></li>
        <li>Check the <i>Allow API access</i> checkbox and submit</li>
        <li>Next, go to <i>Settings > Account > Profile</i></li>
        <li>
          Under the <i>API management</i> tab, enter an API password and submit
        </li>
        <li>
          In EasyRSS, use the following settings:
          <ul>
            <li>
              RSS Service URL:
              <code>https://rss.your-domain.com/api/greader.php</code>
            </li>
            <li>Username: your username</li>
            <li>Password: your <em>API password</em></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Article selectors</h2>

      <p>
        Some sites do something annoying with their RSS feeds: they only share
        the intro paragraph or an excerpt from the piece, rather than the full
        article. An example is Wired, which only shares the article summary and
        links out to their website for the rest of the piece.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img
          src="/img/posts/freshrss/wired-excerpt.jpg"
          alt="A Wired article entitled 'Platforms Are Fighting Online Abuseâ€”but Not the Right Kind', open in FreshRSS. Only a short excerpt is shown, rather than the whole article."
        />
        <caption>
          By default, Wired only lets you see a short excerpt of an article.
        </caption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        FreshRSS lets you work around this by setting CSS article selectors:
        essentially, which CSS element on the page holds the article. Rather
        than fetching the short excerpt from the RSS feed, FreshRSS will instead
        fetch everything inside that CSS element.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img
          src="/img/posts/freshrss/wired-body.jpg"
          alt="The Wired website with the text of the same article highlighted and an overlay showing which CSS classes contain the text content."
        />
        <caption>
          The article's content is contained in an element with the
          <code>.body</code>
          class.
        </caption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        To use this setting, find the CSS element of the site that contains the
        content you want to read. Then enter the name of that setting in the
        feed's
        <i>Settings > Advanced > Article CSS selector on original website</i>.
        Finally, go to the bottom of the <i>Settings</i> and select
        <i>Reload articles</i>, adjusting the number of articles as needed.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img
          src="/img/posts/freshrss/wired-full.jpg"
          alt="The same Wired article open in FreshRSS, now with the full content of the article shown."
        />
        <caption>
          Now we get the full content of the article, not just an excerpt.
        </caption>
      </figure>

      <h2>Feeds I follow</h2>

      <p>
        If you want to see what I follow, I've exposed my FreshRSS instance to
        <a href="https://rss.hd-dn.com">allow you to read it</a>. Part of my
        motivation is laziness &mdash; I don't want to log in everywhere &mdash;
        but also I think it's a cool way to share interesting RSS feeds.
      </p>

      <p>
        One of the cool features of FreshRSS is that it lets you share your
        feeds over RSS: a feed of feeds! I think this is a really neat way of
        finding new feeds to follow or sharing sites you think are cool with
        friends. I don't know if there are communities around sharing RSS feeds,
        but I think this is a really cool idea!
