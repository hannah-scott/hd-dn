        I've had a really good relationship with my smartphone recently, through
        just like — disconnecting the thing from the internet. Things like:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          got into the habit of turning off wifi and mobile data (the big one)
        </li>
        <li>
          browsing gemlogs and personal websites rather than endless scrolling
          apps
        </li>
        <li>
          changed from the stock launcher to OLauncher and hid all the endless
          scrolling apps
          <ul>
            <li>
              OLauncher's hide feature is great, really makes it a hassle to
              open without cutting you off completely
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          downloaded lots of music on Spotify and set my podcatcher to download
          new episodes
        </li>
        <li>tried switching to grayscale mode</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These have all helped, to various extents. I'm checking my phone a lot
        less. Part of the urge to check it so much was the fear of missing out,
        an unchecked notification. I used to just sit with Whatsapp open in case
        I got a message. I have a trained response to get rid of notifications —
        I mean, I really hate seeing unread message notifications. It's 100% a
        compulsion. It kind of worries me how strong the impulse to clear them
        is. I suppose it makes sense: they're literally designed to draw your
        attention.
      </p>
      <p>
        Going offline has helped with it, though. I know that there isn't an
        unread message waiting for me. I can choose to go online and go through
        the loop of clearing notifications and replying to messages — then go
        back offline! I don't see a message notification unless I actively
        choose to.

        I'd like to go further with this. It'd be neat to not have to connect
        every time I want to browse Gemini, for example. Offline-first
        distribution seems to be the current hotness in gemspace at the moment,
        and it's something that would fill that gap. A mobile RSS reader that
        can redirect
        <code>gemini</code> links to my client would work. Mostly I need to add
        more good blogs to my RSS feed.

        Something I wanted to try out was insired by Ploum's offline-only
        computer, where my wifi and mobile network would only turn on if I was
        plugged into a power source. When I'm out of the house, my phone is a
        camera/iPod/emergency contact device. That definitely appeals to me.

        Unfortunately it looks like Google disabled the ability to automate wifi
        settings in Android 10: I'd either have to root my phone or move to an
        open source OS, neither of which I particularly want to do right now. I
        may look into this in the future.
