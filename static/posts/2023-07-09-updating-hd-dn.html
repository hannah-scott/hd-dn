  <h1 class="title">Updating HD-DN</h1>

  <p>
    I've moved over from a Github pages instance to hosting on a VM. Everything
    is being served by a go server that I've written.
  </p>

  <p>
    As part of that workflow, I "borrowed" some ideas from
    <a
      href="https://j3s.sh/thought/my-website-is-one-binary.html"
      target="_blank"
      >j3s</a
    >
    and set up a cronjob to check for any updates on git.
  </p>

  <p>
    And since I've been having server problems today and had to rebuild
    everything (RIP my FreshRSS instance) I'll just dump this here.
  </p>

  <p>Big site update post incoming, this for now though.</p>

  <code>
    <pre>
#!/bin/bash
# Script to autoupdate website based on git repo status

# Set some environment variables. We need these for cron
XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/user/$(id -u)
DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=unix:path=${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/bus
export DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS XDG_RUNTIME_DIR

# Go to the working directory and check for updates
cd /home/hd-dn/hd-dn
git fetch origin
if git status | grep -q behind; then
  git merge origin/mom
  ./build.sh
  systemctl --user restart hd-dn.service
fi
</pre
