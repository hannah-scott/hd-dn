<h1 class="title">About me</h1>

<p>
  I'm a big fan of making things, but I'm better at breaking them. My
  professional background is mathematics and analytics, and by day I'm a data
  science consultant.
</p>

<p>
  My current areas of focus are practicing more ethical styles of interpersonal
  relationships, and testing out mindful approaches to personal tech.

<p>
  HD-DN is my personal website, and my main online presence. I was inspired by
  seeing James Clear's
  <a href="https://jamesclear.com/book-summaries" class="external-link"
    >book summaries</a
  >
  and
  <a href="https://100r.co" class="external-link"
    >Hundred Rabbits' beautiful website</a
  >.
</p>

<p>
  This site is a combination of HTML and Go templates &mdash; I am generating
  things dynamically where I can. I don't use JS, and I don't use trackers. It
  is served by a Go server sat on a cloud machine: I assume my cloud service
  provider does some traffic logging.

<p>
  The header font is
  <a class="external-link" href="https://velvetyne.fr/fonts/outward/"
    >Outward</a
  >
  by Raoul Audouin. Distributed by velvetyne.fr.
</p>

<p>
  The body font is
  <a
    class="external-link"
    href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Amaranth/about"
    >Amaranth</a
  >
  by Gesine Todt.
</p>

<p>
  The monospace font is
  <a class="external-link" href="https://fontlibrary.org/en/font/notcouriersans"
    >NotCourierSans</a
