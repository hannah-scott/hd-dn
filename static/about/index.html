<h1 class="title">About me</h1>

<p>
  I'm a big fan of making things, but I'm better at breaking them. My
  professional background is mathematics and analytics, and by day I'm a data
  science consultant.
</p>

<p>
  My current areas of focus are practicing more ethical styles of interpersonal
  relationships, and testing out mindful approaches to personal tech.

<p>
  HD-DN is my personal website, and my main online presence. I was inspired by
  seeing James Clear's
  <a href="https://jamesclear.com/book-summaries" target="_blank"
    >book summaries</a
  >
  and
  <a href="https://100r.co" target="_blank"
    >Hundred Rabbits' beautiful website</a
  >.
</p>

<p>
  This site is a combination of HTML and Go templates &mdash; I am generating
  things dynamically where I can. I don't use JS, and I don't use trackers. It
  is served by a Go server sat on a cloud machine: I assume my cloud service
  provider does some traffic logging. I don't exert copyright on anything I
  create for this site.

  If you find an issue with the website please

    >raise a ticket on Github</a
  >. I'm not currently focused on optimising the page for mobile devices, so if
  you raise a display issue on mobile it might take some time for me to get to
  it.
