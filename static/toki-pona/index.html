<h1 id="toki-pona">Toki Pona</h1>

<p>
  I really love the constructed language
  <a href="https://tokipona.org/" target="_blank">Toki Pona</a>. I find it fun
  to play around with, communicate in, and even just do housework while talking
  to myself in it.
</p>

<p>
  This is a selection of pages on my site that I've tried to translate into Toki
  Pona. Hopefully I'll keep expanding this, and maybe even have a full
  translation of the site into Toki Pona!
</p>

<p>
  There's also <a href="/toki-pona/tenpo-ni/">tenpo ni</a>, which is a little
  semi-regular diary I keep. Seems like a great way to work on my creative
  writing in toki pona.
