  Hi there! I'm Hannah, and this is HD-DN, my personal website. I write
  <a href="/books/">book summaries</a>, some <a href="/posts/">blog posts</a>,
  and a couple of other things as they grab my interest.
  <small>You can see everything <a href="/meta/">on the meta page</a>.</small>
</p>

<p>
  I also run a tilde server that you can join at
  <a href="https://tilde.hd-dn.com">tilde.hd-dn.com</a>. It's meant for little
  websites and cool tools.
</p>

<p>What's the <a href="/color/">color of the day</a>?</p>
