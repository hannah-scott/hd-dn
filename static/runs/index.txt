We did miles today.
This felt good. I was slow and steady, no walking just movement. I'll keep an eye on my legs for the next couple days.

Felt good! There was some walking for sure but this felt a lot stronger and less exhausting. So far this has been pretty humbling &mdash; my base level of fitness is pretty good from cycling and martial arts, and I assumed that would translate to running. This is definitely a harder transition period than I was expecting.
I've got this!

So! Fucking! Hard!
I got round &mdash; but my legs are much, much weaker than I was expecting them to be. Still, I did make it. Three miles, no walking. Just got to do that (does math) 8 more times in a row and that's the marathon. Easy!
I'm going to have to start at a lower weekly mileage, but I think I should still be able to build my base appropriately and start the actual marathon training plan at a safe place. I have some slack.
So proud of myself for this.
