So! Fucking! Hard!
I got round &mdash; but my legs are much, much weaker than I was expecting them to be. Still, I did make it. Three miles, no walking. Just got to do that (does math) 8 more times in a row and that's the marathon. Easy!
I'm going to have to start at a lower weekly mileage, but I think I should still be able to build my base appropriately and start the actual marathon training plan at a safe place. I have some slack.
So proud of myself for this.
