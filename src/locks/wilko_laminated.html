<h2>Notes</h2>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t ever picked a Master Lock #3 but I can&rsquo;t imagine they&rsquo;re
worse than this. A very sloppy lock, lots of movement in the core. I&rsquo;ve
raked this open in a second by inserting the rake.</p>

<p>The feedback is okay if you use top-of-keyway tension with a pry bar,
but really mushy using bottom-of-keyway tension. If you want an easy
open to build confidence then I&rsquo;d recommend it, but don&rsquo;t expect to
learn much from this.</p>
