<p>I&rsquo;ve had a really good relationship with my smartphone recently, through just like &mdash; disconnecting the thing from the internet. Things like:</p>

<ul>
<li>got into the habit of turning off wifi and mobile data (the big one)</li>
<li>browsing gemlogs and personal websites rather than endless scrolling apps</li>
<li>changed from the stock launcher to OLauncher and hid all the endless scrolling apps

<ul>
<li>OLauncher&rsquo;s hide feature is great, really makes it a hassle to open without cutting you off completely</li>
</ul></li>
<li>downloaded lots of music on Spotify and set my podcatcher to download new episodes</li>
<li>tried switching to grayscale mode</li>
</ul>

<p>These have all helped, to various extents. I&rsquo;m checking my phone a lot less. Part of the urge to check it so much was the fear of missing out, an unchecked notification. I used to just sit with Whatsapp open in case I got a message. I have a trained response to get rid of notifications &mdash; I mean, I really hate seeing unread message notifications. It&rsquo;s 100% a compulsion. It kind of worries me how strong the impulse to clear them is. I suppose it makes sense: they&rsquo;re literally designed to draw your attention.</p>

<p>Going offline has helped with it, though. I know that there isn&rsquo;t an unread message waiting for me. I can choose to go online and go through the loop of clearing notifications and replying to messages &mdash; then go back offline! I don&rsquo;t see a message notification unless I actively choose to.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to go further with this. It&rsquo;d be neat to not have to connect every time I want to browse Gemini, for example. Offline-first distribution seems to be the current hotness in gemspace at the moment, and it&rsquo;s something that would fill that gap. A mobile RSS reader that can redirect <code>gemini</code> links to my client would work. Mostly I need to add more good blogs to my RSS feed.</p>

<p>Something I wanted to try out was insired by Ploum&rsquo;s offline-only computer, where my wifi and mobile network would only turn on if I was plugged into a power source. When I&rsquo;m out of the house, my phone is a camera/iPod/emergency contact device. That definitely appeals to me.</p>

<p>Unfortunately it looks like Google disabled the ability to automate wifi settings in Android 10: I&rsquo;d either have to root my phone or move to an open source OS, neither of which I particularly want to do right now. I may look into this in the future.</p>
