            <p>
                I don't remember where I got this recipe from originally, but
                it's my go-to summer salad &mdash; easy, tastes good, and it
                feels fun. A friend made it recently and said they really liked
                it, so I thought I'd share it. Hope you like it too!
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>2-3 potatoes, any sort, cubed</li>
                <li>white onion, thinly sliced</li>
                <li>garlic clove, finely chopped</li>
                <li>wholegrain mustard</li>
                <li>vegan mayo</li>
                <li>salt</li>
                <li>pepper</li>
                <li>vegetable oil</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Bring a saucepan of water to boil. Put the potatoes in with some
                salt for ~10 minutes until they're cooked through. Meanwhile,
                heat some oil in a frying pan over medium heat and fry the
                onions until they're golden.
            </p>

            <p>
                Once the potatoes are cooked, drain them and set them to one
                side. In the frying pan, add the garlic to the onions and stir
                until fragrant. Turn the heat down low and add the drained
                potatoes. Add the vegan mayo a tablespoon at a time, stirring
                continuously until the texture looks right to you. The amount of
                mayo you need will vary depending on number and size of potatoes
                you used, but it'll probably be 3-4 tablespoons.
            </p>

            <p>
                Add half a tablespoon or so of the wholegrain mustard, salt and
                pepper to taste, and stir everything through. Take off the heat
                and serve.
            </p>
            <p>
                Depending on the mayo you use this can be quite rich, so it goes
                great with anything charred, citrusy or spicy. Have some fun
                with it: my friend threw some capers in at the end, worked
                great.
