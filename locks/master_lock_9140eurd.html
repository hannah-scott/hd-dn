<h2>Pins</h2>

<p>4 standard pins, the first on mine is a zero-lift (or close).</p>

<h2>Difficulty</h2>

<p>Beginner</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<p>A reasonably cheap beginner&rsquo;s lock. Nice feedback and a solid, loud
<em>click</em> on setting. It can be single-pin picked or raked without too
much difficulty.</p>

<p>Based on the pictures I&rsquo;ve seen, you should expect one low- or zero-lift
pin. The keyway is also quite narrow, and I&rsquo;ve had most success with
top-of-keyway tension.</p>

<p>I would definitely recommend this as your first real lock.</p>
