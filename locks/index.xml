Pins 4 standard pins, the first on mine is a zero-lift (or close).
Difficulty Beginner
Notes A reasonably cheap beginner&amp;rsquo;s lock. Nice feedback and a solid, loud click on setting. It can be single-pin picked or raked without too much difficulty.
Based on the pictures I&amp;rsquo;ve seen, you should expect one low- or zero-lift pin. The keyway is also quite narrow, and I&amp;rsquo;ve had most success with top-of-keyway tension.</description>

Pins 4 standard pins
Difficulty Beginner
Notes I haven&amp;rsquo;t ever picked a Master Lock #3 but I can&amp;rsquo;t imagine they&amp;rsquo;re worse than this. A very sloppy lock, lots of movement in the core. I&amp;rsquo;ve raked this open in a second by inserting the rake.
The feedback is okay if you use top-of-keyway tension with a pry bar, but really mushy using bottom-of-keyway tension. If you want an easy open to build confidence then I&amp;rsquo;d recommend it, but don&amp;rsquo;t expect to learn much from this.</description>

Pins 5 standard pins, nothing weird going on
Difficulty Beginner to advanced beginner
Notes This was a tricky lock to get open. The plug has enough slack that it turns almost up to the point where the lock will open, meaning once I apply pressure the lock basically stops. There&amp;rsquo;s very little movement between a pin binding and not binding.
Once you figure it out it&amp;rsquo;s a relatively easy 5-pin lock, and is also quite quick to rake.</description>

Dials 4 dials numbered 0-9
Difficulty Beginner
Notes This is a terrible lock.
If you haven&amp;rsquo;t worked on combination locks before, one method of decoding is to pull up on the shackle and turn the dials, feeling for when each number sets. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen a couple of videos of this being done on the Rolson, but it&amp;rsquo;s completely unnecessary. It turns out, you can actually see inside the lock mechanism and decode it by sight.</description>
