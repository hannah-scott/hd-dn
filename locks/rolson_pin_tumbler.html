<p>This was a tricky lock to get open. The plug has enough slack that it turns almost up to the point where the lock will open, meaning once I apply pressure the lock basically stops. There’s very little movement between a pin binding and not binding.</p>
<p>Once you figure it out it’s a relatively easy 5-pin lock, and is also quite quick to rake. It is very cheap, so I would probably recommend this to people as a second or third lock.</p>
