<h3>The two golden rules of lockpicking</h3>

<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t pick a lock you don&rsquo;t own &mdash; it&rsquo;s rude and disrespectful</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t pick a lock that&rsquo;s in use &mdash; you might break it and then you&rsquo;re fucked</li>
</ul>


<p>In my opinion those guidelines, followed by people who aren&rsquo;t deliberately
being dicks, are enough to ensure no-one is hurt by recreational lockpicking.</p>

<p>The police do not agree.</p>

<p>In the UK where I live, lockpicks are treated a lot like knives. You are
completely within your rights to own them, but <strong>it is illegal to carry them</strong>
unless you have a good justification for doing so. Simply having them on you in
public can be considered evidence that you are planning to steal something.</p>

<p>I disagree with this law. <em>Good justification</em> is a ill-defined term, meaning
that a lot of power and discretion is put into the hands of police officers &mdash;
a group with a long history of abusing power and discretion.  But the law
exists, there&rsquo;s no real appetite to change it, so we have to navigate it.</p>

<p>I never have lockpicks on me unless I can avoid it &mdash; for example, if I&rsquo;m
moving home. This is a personal decision I&rsquo;ve made, because for me the risk
outweighs the benefit. I&rsquo;m not going to tell you what to do, but I do think
it&rsquo;s important we&rsquo;re aware of any risks we take.</p>
