<h3 id="the-two-golden-rules-of-lockpicking">The two golden rules of lockpicking</h3>
<ul>
<li>Don’t pick a lock you don’t own — it’s rude and disrespectful</li>
<li>Don’t pick a lock that’s in use — you might break it and then you’re fucked</li>
</ul>
<p>In my opinion those guidelines are enough to ensure no-one is hurt by recreational lockpicking. They are clear, concise, and reasonable.</p>
<p>The police do not agree.</p>
<p>In the UK where I live, lockpicks are treated a lot like knives. You are completely within your rights to own them, but <strong>it is illegal to carry them</strong> unless you have a good justification for doing so. If you are stopped and searched, simply having them on you in public can be considered evidence that you are planning to steal something.</p>
<p>I disagree with this law. I disagree with a lot of laws. But it exists, there’s no real appetite to change it, so we have to navigate it.</p>
<p>I never have lockpicks on me unless I can avoid it — for example, if I’m moving home. This is a personal decision I’ve made, because for me the risk outweighs the benefit. I’m not going to tell you what to do, but I do think it’s important we’re aware of any risks we take.</p>
