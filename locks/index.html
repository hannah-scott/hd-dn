            <h3 id="i-am-not-a-lawyer-this-is-not-legal-advice">I am not a lawyer, this is not legal advice</h3>
<p>In the UK where I live, lockpicks are treated a lot like knives. While you are completely within your rights to buy them, <strong>it is illegal to carry them outside your home without a reasonable excuse.</strong> If the police search you and you have lockpicks on you, that can be considered as evidence that you were going to commit a crime.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t agree with this law. It puts power and discretion into the hands of police officers, a group with a well-documented history of abusing any power and discretion they get. But we do have to navigate this law and deal with cops.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a professional locksmith on your way to a job you will be fine. For non-professionals and hobbyists it&rsquo;s more vague. Personally I don&rsquo;t carry picks unless I absolutely cannot avoid it, e.g. moving house. That&rsquo;s a decision I have made for myself. Your appetite for risk may vary and I&rsquo;m not going to tell you what to do.</p>
<p>Also while I do include links to buy some of the locks I talk about, these are <strong>not affiliate links</strong>. I make no money from you using them.</p>
