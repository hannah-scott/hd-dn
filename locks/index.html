<h3>The two golden rules of lockpicking</h3>

<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t pick a lock you don&rsquo;t own &mdash; it&rsquo;s rude and disrespectful</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t pick a lock that&rsquo;s in use &mdash; you might break it and then you&rsquo;re fucked</li>
</ul>


<p>In my opinion those guidelines are enough to ensure no-one is hurt by
recreational lockpicking. They are clear, concise, and reasonable.</p>

<p>The police do not agree.</p>

<p>In the UK where I live, lockpicks are treated a lot like knives. You are
completely within your rights to own them, but <strong>it is illegal to carry them</strong>
unless you have a good justification for doing so. If you are stopped and
searched, simply having them on you in public can be considered evidence that
you are planning to steal something.</p>

<p>I disagree with this law. I disagree with a lot of laws. But it exists, there&rsquo;s
no real appetite to change it, so we have to navigate it.</p>

<p>I never have lockpicks on me unless I can avoid it &mdash; for example, if I&rsquo;m
moving home. This is a personal decision I&rsquo;ve made, because for me the risk
outweighs the benefit. I&rsquo;m not going to tell you what to do, but I do think
it&rsquo;s important we&rsquo;re aware of any risks we take.</p>
