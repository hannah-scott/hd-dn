## Three Sentence Summary

A detailed overview of historically dominant strains of liberalism, as
embodied by the editors of the *Economist*. This liberalism is
identified with:

-   the preference for financial elites as political decision-makers,
    over open democracy
-   a belief in empire (both British and later American) and the use of
    force to ensure free trade for imperial investors
-   a laissez-faire approach to domestic finance wherever possible,
    leaving government to resolve crises as they developed

The *Economist* not only shaped and spread this policy, but as editors
both came from and moved into powerful financial and political
positions, it played a role in implementing it too.

## Chapter Summaries

### 0. Introduction 

Classical liberalism evolved in Britain as a aligning of economic
freedoms with political ones: low taxes, a free press and responsible
government. Despite this coherent agenda, some details are unanswered:

-   to whom should governments be responsible?
-   can liberalism be imperial and expansionist?
-   should money be considered a commodity like any other?

The *Economist* has been a vocal champion of the "*dominant* strain of
liberalism" since its inception, and has become both popular and
influential among liberal politicians and business people.

### 1. Free Trade Empire 

James Wilson, founder and first editor of the *Economist*, rose to
political prominence by opposing the Corn Laws and labour reforms and
instead espousing laissez-faire solutions to society's ills. So much did
the influence of the *Economist* and liberalism grow, that financial aid
was refused during the Irish Potato Famine on the premise that free
trade could resolve it: 1.5 million people died. Meanwhile Wilson used
his paper's influence to pursue a political career, rising to Chancellor
of the Indian Exchequer and advocating bloody imperial wars "from the
view that laissez-faire may best be furthered through the barrel of a
gun".

### 2. Walter Bagehot's Dashed Doubts 

The son-in-law of James Wilson, Walter Bagehot likewise used the
*Economist* as both a platform for his brand of liberalism as well, as a
political springboard. He considered the working classes "dim" and
"stupid", opposing democracy in favour of "plac\[ing\] the substantial
power in the hands of men of education and of property". A belief in
'national character' led him --- and the *Economist* ---- to support
expansion of the British and French Empires, take the side of the South
in the American Civil War, and oppose the Paris Commune, all of which
were at odds with more 'Radical' Liberals of the day.

### 3. Edward Johnstone and the Aristocracy of Finance 

In the late 19th century the *Economist* continued its staunch defense
of empire, having ample evidence that imperial rule "structured the
world economy and made it safe for capital". Under this analysis
*British* imperialism was seen as the superior form, being particularly
extractive, open to capital, and brutally retaliatory to any disruption
of British investments. But after Gladstone granted Home Rule to
Ireland, the Liberals split over issues of imperialism and Irish
self-determination --- with the *Economist* calling the Conservatives
the true party of the investor, until protectionist policies made them
unpalatable too.

### 4. Landslide Liberalism 

Francis Hirst, in contrast to his predecessors, supported Home Rule and
was opposed to more expansionist Liberal imperialism, on both fiscal and
humanitarian grounds. He opposed the Boer War, and when the First World
War broke out his writings were deeply negative: he wrote constantly in
support of peace and a return to laissez-faire profit-making. But he was
fired in 1916 and replaced with a more nationalist liberal called
Hartley Withers, who spread the message of Financial Patriotism and the
role that the City could play in winning the war --- whilst still
securing a profit.

### 5. Own Gold 

Three trends seem to have dominated Walter Layton's tenure, namely:

-   the rise of Keynesianism and the move away from the gold standard
-   growing influence of America's banks after World War One, followed
    by the Great Depression
-   the formation and eventual breakdown of the League of Nations, and
    the rise of fascism in Europe

Despite America buying up gold and reducing the Bank of England's
control of its own currency, proving Keynes right, the *Economist* grew
in popularity during this area --- and was sold to new owners, curated
by Layton himself. This new ownership, along with a more left-leaning
(but still firmly laissez-faire) younger staff, cemented the split from
the Liberal Party proper as the *Economist* began to court and influence
Labour politicians in the ways of the free market.

### 6. Extreme Centre 

Geoffrey Crowther's tenure, as well as his position as a non-executive
director for Donald Tyerman, saw the *Economist* expound an "extreme
centre" ideology. This was Crowther's revival of liberalism, which after
the Second World War was based on:

-   a fazed end to empire in favour of preferential British investments
    (read: neocolonialism)
-   deference to America and the importance of the "special
    relationship"
-   a broadly pacifistic outlook, believing lost trade would be enough
    motivation for peace

This pacifist mindset did not extend to Communist states: the
*Economist* supported the USA brutally putting down central American
revolutions in the name of capitalist democracy, as well as the French
attack on Ho Chi Minh's movement.

### 7. Liberal Cold Warriors 

Under the Conservative Alistair Burnet and his successors Andrew Knight
and Rupert Pennant-Rea, sycophancy towards the USA turned into support
for military expansion and slaughter of leftists. The continued use of
some writers as CIA mouthpieces gave intellectual credence to atrocities
committed by rightists in Vietnam, Cambodia and Nicaragua --- under the
guise of opposing Soviet Communism. The *Economist* opposing
neoliberalism until quite late, but once Thatcher and Reagan proved they
could win elections it became a full convert --- advocating
neoliberalism at home and neoimperialism abroad.

### 8. Globalisation and Its Contents 

A pro-America, pro-globalisation stance has only gained fervour under
Bill Emmott, John Micklethwait and Zanny Minton Beddoes (the first
female editor). Following 9/11, the *Economist* immediately called for
war (despite it being unable to "define the exact objective") andsupported immediate regime change in Iraq, believing that free trade was
"a way of helping countries help themselves" rebuild in the aftermath.
This same belief in both globalisation and free trade led it to support
crushing austerity following the 2008 crash, under the impression that
regulation of banks would only slow down economic recovery.

### 9. Conclusion 

Beginning with an overview of Edmund Fawcett's *Liberalism: The Life of
an Idea*, Zevin identifies an apologist view of liberalism: responsible
for all goods, confused as to the cause of crises, and where wrong at
least wrong for the right reasons. In reality, the dominant strain of
liberalism as embodied by the *Economist* viewed:

-   democracy as anathema to financial growth
-   empire, both British and American, as a positive force
-   finance as a force for emancipation, peace --- and profit

The *Economist* not only spread this message, but shaped it, and through
its ties to high politics and finance implemented it too.
