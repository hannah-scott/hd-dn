# The Pornography of Meat

## Carol J. Adams

### 1. What Pornography?

The chapter lists examples of the conflation of sexual exploitation of women
with meat consumption. Adams connects these two as consumptive: the use of
some-_thing_ by some-_one_. She relates the design of pornography to that of
advertising, noting that looking at pornography is essentially reinforcement of
arousal cues.

### 2. More Than Meat

Adams defines a formula for the _absent referent_:

a body, human or animal + butchering = "meat", consumable, destruction of
subject status.

She makes the point that 'meat', 'beef' etc. are abstracted terms --- that by
butchering an animal we remove its status as some-_one_. She then compares this
to the way in which pornography abstracts and recontextualises body parts,
'butchering' the body of (typically) a woman with a lens and turning them into
consumable objects.

### 3. Man To Man

The "public voice" of that advertising and everyday speech uses is explicitly a
male voice. Both portray meat-eating, sexual objectification of woman and
social dominance: they server as a "male call" that vocalises and confirms the
consumer's identity. In this way, meat + sex + violence (all active actions
taken against some other) become points of social bonding between men.

### 4. Yoked Oppression

Advertising depicts social relations as a zero-sum hierarchy, advancing the
dominance of some-_one_ over some-_thing_. This is illustrated by Adams with
the A/NOT A duality, which is implicitly a hierarchy:

|A|NOT A|
|---|---|
|MAN|WOMAN|
|WHITE|PERSON OF COLOUR|
|HUMAN|ANIMAL|

These NOT A objectified groups a "yoked" together in advertisement imaging,
reinforcing each other's object status and the social dominance of the "A".
