  <h1>The Pornography of Meat</h1>
  <h2>Carol J. Adams</h2>
  <h3>1. What Pornography?</h3>
  <p>The chapter lists examples of the conflation of sexual exploitation of
  women with meat consumption. Adams connects these two as consumptive: the use
  of some-<em>thing</em> by some-<em>one</em>. She relates the design of
  pornography to that of advertising, noting that looking at pornography is
  essentially reinforcement of arousal cues.</p>
  <h3>2. More Than Meat</h3>
  <p>Adams defines a formula for the <em>absent referent</em>:</p>
  <p>a body, human or animal + butchering = “meat”, consumable, destruction of
  subject status.</p>
  <p>She makes the point that ‘meat’, ‘beef’ etc. are abstracted terms — that
  by butchering an animal we remove its status as some-<em>one</em>. She then
  compares this to the way in which pornography abstracts and recontextualises
  body parts, ‘butchering’ the body of (typically) a woman with a lens and
  turning them into consumable objects.</p>
  <h3>3. Man To Man</h3>
  <p>The “public voice” of that advertising and everyday speech uses is
  explicitly a male voice. Both portray meat-eating, sexual objectification of
  woman and social dominance: they server as a “male call” that vocalises and
  confirms the consumer’s identity. In this way, meat + sex + violence (all
  active actions taken against some other) become points of social bonding
  between men.</p>
  <h3>4. Yoked Oppression</h3>
  <p>Advertising depicts social relations as a zero-sum hierarchy, advancing
  the dominance of some-<em>one</em> over some-<em>thing</em>. This is
  illustrated by Adams with the A/NOT A duality, which is implicitly a
  hierarchy:</p>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>A</th>
        <th>NOT A</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>MAN</td>
        <td>WOMAN</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>WHITE</td>
        <td>PERSON OF COLOUR</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>HUMAN</td>
        <td>ANIMAL</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <p>These NOT A objectified groups a “yoked” together in advertisement
  imaging, reinforcing each other’s object status and the social dominance of
  the “A”.</p>
