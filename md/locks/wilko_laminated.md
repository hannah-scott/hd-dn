## Notes

I haven't ever picked a Master Lock \#3 but I can't imagine they're
worse than this. A very sloppy lock, lots of movement in the core. I've
raked this open in a second by inserting the rake.

The feedback is okay if you use top-of-keyway tension with a pry bar,
but really mushy using bottom-of-keyway tension. If you want an easy
open to build confidence then I'd recommend it, but don't expect to
learn much from this.
