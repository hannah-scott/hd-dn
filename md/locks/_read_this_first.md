### The two golden rules of lockpicking

- Don't pick a lock you don't own --- it's rude and disrespectful
- Don't pick a lock that's in use --- you might break it and then you're fucked

In my opinion those guidelines, followed by people who aren't deliberately
being dicks, are enough to ensure no-one is hurt by recreational lockpicking.

The police do not agree.

In the UK where I live, lockpicks are treated a lot like knives. You are
completely within your rights to own them, but **it is illegal to carry them**
unless you have a good justification for doing so. Simply having them on you in
public can be considered evidence that you are planning to steal something.

I disagree with this law. _Good justification_ is a ill-defined term, meaning
that a lot of power and discretion is put into the hands of police officers ---
a group with a long history of abusing power and discretion.  But the law
exists, there's no real appetite to change it, so we have to navigate it.

I never have lockpicks on me unless I can avoid it --- for example, if I'm
moving home. This is a personal decision I've made, because for me the risk
outweighs the benefit. I'm not going to tell you what to do, but I do think
it's important we're aware of any risks we take.
