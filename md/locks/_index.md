### The two golden rules of lockpicking

- Don't pick a lock you don't own --- it's rude and disrespectful
- Don't pick a lock that's in use --- you might break it and then you're fucked

In my opinion those guidelines are enough to ensure no-one is hurt by
recreational lockpicking. They are clear, concise, and reasonable.

The police do not agree.

In the UK where I live, lockpicks are treated a lot like knives. You are
completely within your rights to own them, but **it is illegal to carry them**
unless you have a good justification for doing so. If you are stopped and
searched, simply having them on you in public can be considered evidence that
you are planning to steal something.

I disagree with this law. I disagree with a lot of laws. But it exists, there's
no real appetite to change it, so we have to navigate it.

I never have lockpicks on me unless I can avoid it --- for example, if I'm
moving home. This is a personal decision I've made, because for me the risk
outweighs the benefit. I'm not going to tell you what to do, but I do think
it's important we're aware of any risks we take.
