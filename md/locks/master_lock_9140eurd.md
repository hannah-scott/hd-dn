## Pins

4 standard pins, the first on mine is a zero-lift (or close).

## Difficulty

Beginner

## Notes

A reasonably cheap beginner's lock. Nice feedback and a solid, loud
*click* on setting. It can be single-pin picked or raked without too
much difficulty.

Based on the pictures I've seen, you should expect one low- or zero-lift
pin. The keyway is also quite narrow, and I've had most success with
top-of-keyway tension.

I would definitely recommend this as your first real lock.
