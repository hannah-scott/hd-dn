## Pins

5 standard pins, nothing weird going on

## Difficulty

Beginner to advanced beginner

## Notes

This was a tricky lock to get open. The plug has enough slack that it
turns almost up to the point where the lock will open, meaning once I
apply pressure the lock basically stops. There's very little movement
between a pin binding and not binding.

Once you figure it out it's a relatively easy 5-pin lock, and is also
quite quick to rake. It is very cheap, so I would probably recommend
this to people as a second or third lock.
