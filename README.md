This is my personal website.

It is made using

- [discount](https://www.pell.portland.or.us/~orc/Code/discount/) for MD-\>HTML
  conversion
- my static site tool [cite](https://github.com/hannah-scott/cite)

and a bit of shell scripting as glue.

If you spot any typos or dead links, please let me know.
