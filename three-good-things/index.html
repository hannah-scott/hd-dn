        <h1>Three Good Things</h1>

        <p>
            On 2022-07-30 as part of a process of self-esteem and positive
            self-talk, I started posting a list of three good things that had
            happened to me every day on Mastodon. I've found this a lovely
            practice. It has already started to evolve to only include good
            things that
            <em>I personally had an impact on</em>, in an effort to centre my
            own agency.
        </p>

        <p>
            I've formatted this page as a
            <a href="https://journal.miso.town/" target="_blank">journal</a>,
            which I might do something with in the future.
        </p>
