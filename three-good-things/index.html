        <h1>Three Good Things</h1>

        <p>
            On 2022-07-30 as part of a process of self-esteem and positive
            self-talk, I started posting a list of three good things that had
            happened to me every day on Mastodon. I've found this a lovely
            practice. It has already started to evolve to only include good
            things that
            <em>I personally had an impact on</em>, in an effort to centre my
            own agency.
        </p>

        <p>
            I've formatted this page as a
            <a href="https://journal.miso.town/">journal</a>, which I might do
            something with in the future.
        </p>

                    I dialed in the new coffee and had a couple of espressos -
                    really tasty with a strong strawberry smell 🍓

                    I moved my website over to using Atkinson Hyperlegible,
                    which I really like the look of and is allegedly very
                    readable 💻

                    I ordered coffee from a local roaster that I believe to be a
                    more ethical bunch, and it arrived today! Can't wait to try
                    it ☕

                    Did some impromptu testing of the NHS gender identity

                    Went to the library to return some books, and got out "The

                    I watched some of the Alex Jones trial, the parents'
                    testimony was deeply moving. I'm glad they get to hold him
                    accountable.
