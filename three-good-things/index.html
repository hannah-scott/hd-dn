        <h1>Three Good Things</h1>

        <p>
            On 2022-07-30 as part of a process of self-esteem and positive
            self-talk, I started posting a list of three good things that had
            happened to me every day on Mastodon. I've found this a lovely
            practice. It has already started to evolve to only include good
            things that
            <em>I personally had an impact on</em>, in an effort to centre my
            own agency.
        </p>

                    I decided to go for a sub-45 in
                    <i>Celeste</i> any%, and got a new PD of 45:43 on my second
                    serious run. I've completely got this.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Made plans to go on holiday with someone lovely in October
                    &mdash; and to see the other lovely person in my life next
                    week!

                <li>
                    I had a sinus headache today, so trying be kind to myself.
                    Ate good food, wrapped up warm, and rested. Making a
                    conscious effort not to shame myself for resting and
                    recovering. On the plus side &mdash; I got a cold, it's
                    officially autumn!

                    Had breakfast with a person, coffee and chill times in the

                <li>
                    I started learning the spike jump and double wall bounce in
                    4A &mdash; wow, spike jumps are easy! I always thought they
                    were way outside my skillset!
                </li>
                <li>
                    I bought a really cute fancy jumpsuit for a work do next
                    week. I'm not the most "trad fancy clothing", but it's nice
                    to dress fancy sometimes!

                    Had dinner & a chill night in with a lovely person &mdash;
                    we made broth and dumplings and watched

                <li>
                    I learnt 2 new skips in <i>Celeste</i>: a spike jump in 5B
                    that I probably won't use in runs, and another spike jump in
                    7A that I definitely will!

                    I "did self-care": meditated, went for a run, and did my

                I was honestly very dysphoric this morning. So I tried hard to
                be kind to myself today, and I feel like I did a good job.

                    a smartwatch, and my iPod for music. It did really well!
                    Couple of minor memory problems but nothing a reboot
