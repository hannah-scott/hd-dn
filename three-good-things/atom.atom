   &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;                    I decided to go for a sub-45 in                    &lt;i&gt;Celeste&lt;/i&gt; any%, and got a new PB of 45:43 on my second                    serious run. I've completely got this.                &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;                    Made plans to go on holiday in October — and to see a                    lot of people next week!                &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;                    I had a sinus headache today, so trying be kind to myself.                    Ate good food, wrapped up warm, and rested. Making a                    conscious effort not to shame myself for resting and                    recovering. On the plus side — I got a cold, it's                    officially autumn!                &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

   &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;                    Had breakfast with a person, coffee and chill times in the                    morning. Great start to the day.                &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;                    I started learning the spike jump and double wall bounce in                    4A — wow, spike jumps are easy! I always thought they                    were way outside my skillset!                &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;                    I bought a really cute fancy jumpsuit for a work do next                    week. I'm not the most "trad fancy clothing", but it's nice                    to dress fancy sometimes!                &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

   &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;                    Had dinner &amp;amp; a chill night in with a lovely person —                    we made broth and dumplings and watched                    &lt;i&gt;National Treasure&lt;/i&gt;.                &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;                    My in-person counselling was signed off by the insurer, so                    I'll hopefully be starting that soon!                &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;                    I learnt 2 new skips in &lt;i&gt;Celeste&lt;/i&gt;: a spike jump in 5B                    that I probably won't use in runs, and another spike jump in                    7A that I definitely will!                &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

   &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;                    Got a lot of work done, including some stuff that I don't                    think anyone else would've looked at yet. Hopefully has                    value.                &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;                    I "did self-care": meditated, went for a run, and did my                    stretches. I had a good lunch, too. Trying to make time for                    myself.                &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;                    I'm going to eat some pizza and watch videos, just relax                    tonight.                &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

Hopefully a positive step for                    my mental wellbeing, despite how much the initial call shook                    me.                &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;                    I went to my self-defense class, which was really fun                    — we did a takedown and lots of punching!                &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;                Had a positive but taxing conversation last night that led to me                not getting much sleep, so today I've been focusing on self-care                and self-worth.            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;                    Got a couple of cheap USB thumbsticks and loaded them up                    with files to share with friends and loved ones.                &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;                    I've had a stiff back for a couple of days, so I took time                    to do stretches and that's really eased it off — maybe                    something I should do more often?                &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;                    Read a couple of zines/essays on anarchism and polyamory,                    &lt;a href="https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/susan-song-polyamory-and-queer-anarchism-infinite-possibilities-for-resistance" target="_blank"&gt;Polyamory and Queer Anarchism&lt;/a&gt;                    is a good theoretical primer to go with the emotion and                    practice of                    &lt;a href="https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/andie-nordgren-the-short-instructional-manifesto-for-relationship-anarchy" target="_blank"&gt;Nordgren&lt;/a&gt;.

Lots of calls though so I'm pretty tired!                &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;                    I went to the post office to pick up coffee for this month                    — excited to try a cup tomorrow.                &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;                    The first three months of prints from                    &lt;a href="https://ritualdust.com/works/print/henbane/" target="_blank"&gt;Ritual Dust's print club&lt;/a&gt;                    arrived today!

   &lt;p&gt;                I was honestly very dysphoric this morning. So I tried hard to                be kind to myself today, and I feel like I did a good job.            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;                    I had a delicious lunch, went for a walk, and bought some                    cursed chewing gum (raspberry and vanilla flavour).                &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;                    I opted for more old-school tech today: neon pink F91-W over                    a smartwatch, and my iPod for music. It did really well!                    Couple of minor memory problems but nothing a reboot                    couldn't fix.                &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;                    I went to my queer self-defense class and got a drink with                    them after — everyone is so lovely and fun.                &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

   &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;                    I got a really pleasant big day planner, which hopefully                    should help me function a bit better day-to-day.                &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;                    Played some more &lt;i&gt;Thumper&lt;/i&gt;, finished level 6 which has                    some really tough sections at the end.                &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;                    Made some time to read after work — I've started                    reading                    &lt;a href="https://biggsrbr.weebly.com/uploads/8/7/4/4/8744974/the-tao-of-pooh-by-benjamin-hoff1.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Tao of Pooh&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;                    as part of my intermittent Le Guin-inspired Taoism reading.                &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
