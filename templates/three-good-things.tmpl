<h1>Three Good Things</h1>

<p>
  Since July 2022 I've tried to make a habit of noting three good things
  that have happened throughout the day. This has done good for my mental
  health, and serves as a nice little diary of my life too!
</p>

<p>
  I noted three good things on {{ len .Articles }} days so far!
