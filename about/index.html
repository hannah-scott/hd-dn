        <h1 class="title">About me</h1>

        <p>
            I'm a big fan of making things. I'm a bigger fan of breaking things,
            forgetting to fix them and moving on to something else. My current
            areas of focus are trying to practice a more ethical style of
            interpersonal relationships, and testing out mindful approaches to
            personal tech.

        <p>
            HD-DN is my personal website, and my main online presence. I was
            inspired by seeing James Clear's
            <a href="https://jamesclear.com/book-summaries">book summaries</a>
            and
            <a href="https://100r.co">Hundred Rabbits' beautiful website</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strike>
                This site is built with a static site generator I wrote in
                Python as a personal project, which I call ilo lipu. It's based
                off of cite, the original build tool for this site that I wrote
                in C.
            </strike>
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm in the process of hand-rewriting the website, because I enjoy
            doing it and I want to learn more about good HTML practices.

            This site uses a self-hosted copy of
            <a href="https://brailleinstitute.org/freefont"
                >Atkinson Hyperlegible</a
            >.

            If you find an issue with the website please
            <a href="https://github.com/hannah-scott/hd-dn/issues"
                >raise a ticket on Github</a
            >. I'm not currently focused on optimising the page for mobile
            devices, so if you raise a display issue on mobile it might take
            some time for me to get to it.
