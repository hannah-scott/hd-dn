        <h1 class="title">About me</h1>

        <p>
            I'm a big fan of making things, but I'm better at breaking them. My
            professional background is mathematics and analytics, and by day I'm
            a data science consultant.
        </p>

        <p>
            My current areas of focus are practicing more ethical styles of
            interpersonal relationships, and testing out mindful approaches to
            personal tech.
        </p>

        <h2 id="hd-dn">HD-DN</h2>
        <p>
            HD-DN is my personal website, and my main online presence. I was
            inspired by seeing James Clear's
            <a href="https://jamesclear.com/book-summaries" target="_blank"
                >book summaries</a
            >
            and
            <a href="https://100r.co" target="_blank"
                >Hundred Rabbits' beautiful website</a
            >.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strike>
                This site is built with a static site generator I wrote in
                Python as a personal project, which I call ilo lipu. It's based
                off of cite, the original build tool for this site that I wrote
                in C.
            </strike>
        </p>
        <p>
            This site is all hand-written HTML. I don't use JS, and I don't use
            trackers. It is hosted on Github Pages, who I assume do some
            tracking. I don't exert copyright on anything I create for this
            site.

            devices, so if you raise a display issue on mobile it might take
            some time for me to get to it.
