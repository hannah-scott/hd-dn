<h1 class="title">About me</h1>
</header>
<p>I’m a big fan of making things. I’m a bigger fan of breaking things, forgetting to fix them and moving on to something else. My current areas of focus are trying to practice a more ethical style of relationships, and testing out mindful ways to use personal tech.</p>
<h2 id="hd-dn">HD-DN</h2>
<p>HD-DN is my personal website, and my main online presence. I was inspired by seeing James Clear’s <a href="https://jamesclear.com/book-summaries">book summaries</a> and <a href="https://100r.co">Hundred Rabbits’ beautiful website</a>.</p>
<p>This site is built with a static site generator I wrote in Python as a personal project, which I call ilo lipu. It’s based off of cite, the original build tool for this site that I wrote in C.</p>
<h2 id="font">Font</h2>
<p>This site uses a self-hosted copy of <a href="https://brailleinstitute.org/freefont">Atkinson Hyperlegible</a>.</p>
<h2 id="contact">Contact</h2>
<p>If you find an issue with the website please <a href="https://github.com/hannah-scott/hd-dn/issues">raise a ticket on Github</a>. I don’t use social media much, but if you want to say hi then my DMs are open on <a href="https://mastodon.lol/@hannah">Mastodon</a> (be pleasant).</p>    </div>
