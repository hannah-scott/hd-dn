<h1 class="title">About me</h1>
</header>
<p>I’m a big fan of making things. I’m a bigger fan of breaking things, forgetting to fix them and moving on to something else. My current areas of focus are <a href="/posts/2022-new-years-resolutions/">badminton</a> and testing out mindful approaches to personal tech.</p>
<h2 id="hd-dn">HD-DN</h2>
<p>HD-DN is my personal website, and my main online presence. I was inspired by seeing James Clear’s <a href="https://jamesclear.com/book-summaries">book summaries</a> and <a href="https://100r.co">Hundred Rabbits’ beautiful website</a>.</p>
<p><del>I recently moved from handwritten HTML + Sass to a Hugo build and automated a lot of the conversion from HTML to Markdown, so there may be some weirdness.</del></p>
<p>I’ve moved back to <code>cite</code>, a static site generator I wrote in C. So, additional jank expected.</p>
